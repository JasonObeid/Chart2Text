It may seem strange that a metropolitan area can contain cities and areas in different states , such as the New York-Newark-Jersey City metro area , but there is a specific reason as to why that is : According to the U.S. Census Bureau , a metropolitan statistical area is either one or more counties that has a city in it with a population of 50,000 inhabitants or more , or is an area defined by the Census with a population of 100,000 or more . Metropolitan areas are particularly helpful in tracking demographic change over time in large communities and allow officials to see where the largest pockets of inhabitants are in the country .\n"
