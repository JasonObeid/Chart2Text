   "gold": "In 2019 , 0.89 percent of the loans that banks in the United States held were non-performing . This means that 99 percent of loan recipients were repaying their bank back at that time , which is a significant improvement from the 5.3 percent of non-performing loans in the aftermath of the Financial Crisis . What are non-performing loans ? Banks do not expect all the loans they issue to be fully repaid .\n"
