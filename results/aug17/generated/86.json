   "gold": "The total health expenditure in South Korea in 2018 accounted for approximately 8.1 percent of Korea 's Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) that year . This was the result of the steepest increase in the past ten years and was the first time health spending as a share of the GDP exceeded eight percent . This share saw a continuous increase over the past decade , indicating that as the GDP grew , health spending grew at an even faster rate .\n"
