   "gold": "As of June 2019 , out of all Ultimate Fighting Championship ( UFC ) events so far UFC 193 \u2013 Rousey vs. Holm on November 14th 2015 in Melbourne , Australia had the highest gate attendance with a total of 56,214 attendees , followed closely by UFC 129 \u2013 St. Pierre vs Shields on April 30th 2011 in Toronto Canada with a total attendance of 55,724 . Conor McGregor highest overall direct fight earnings When looking at the highest total earnings among fighters , directly resulting from UFC fights , Conor McGregor , who officially retired on March 26th 2019 from Mixed Martial Arts ( MMA ) , is still at first place with approximately 12 million U.S. dollars . However it is safe to say that this only a small fraction compared to his entire earnings , including Pay-Per-View bonuses , endorsement deals and not to mention his boxing match against Floyd Mayweather , for which alone he made more than 75 million U.S. dollars .\n"
