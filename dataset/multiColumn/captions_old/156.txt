 In the wake of the Brexit referendum of 2016 Europe suddenly became an important issue to British people with 28 percent of respondents identifying it as the most important issue facing the country, increasing to 47 percent of people in 2019. Prior to 2016, however the issue barely registered with most of the public, with only three percent of people saying it was an important issue in 2015, with even lower percentages in the years before this point. Immigration and the economy From 2008 until 2013, the economy was the most important issue to British people, with immigration taking over in 2014 and 2015, just before Brexit and Europe took center stage. In the wake of the financial crash of 2008 the British economy contracted by 0.5 percent then by 4.2 percent in the following year. The economy steadily became less important an issue to people as the recovery slowly gathered pace in the following years. No-end in sight for Brexit saga Theresa May’s failure to get her Brexit deal through the House of Commons three times has meant that the Brexit drama has continued for far longer than most British people expected. After months of further political drama throughout the summer, the UK will once again head to the polls in a General Election set to take place on December 12, 2019.
