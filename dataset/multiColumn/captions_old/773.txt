 In 2018, Spain had the highest rate of deceased donors in Europe. The rate of organ donation, including donation after brain death (DBD) and after cardiac death (DCD), was 48.3 per million population. Croatia had the second highest rate of deceased organ donation in Europe after increasing to a rate of 40.2 per million population. Estonia experienced the largest increase in the rate of organ donation between 2017 and 2018, going from 13.8 to 25.4 donors per million population. Waiting times for organs Among the Eurotransplant community (composed of Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Netherlands and Slovenia) almost two thousand individuals died while on the transplant waiting list in 2017. Over half of those that died on the list were waiting for a kidney, followed by around a quarter waiting for a liver. Situation in the UK In the period 2018/19, almost four thousand organ donations were carried out in the UK, this figure has generally increased in recent years. There were over six thousand patients on the transplant waiting list in the UK in 2018, indicating that although the number of transplants is increasing, the amount is still not enough to match the demand for organs.
