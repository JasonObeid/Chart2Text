The Canadian mushroom market Canada produces a large quantity of mushrooms for consumption. In 2018, farmers produced approximately 117,880 metric tons of fresh mushrooms. Production levels have increased by around 20 percent since 2012. Production is not evenly spread across the country due to differing growing conditions – Ontario and British Columbia are the leading provinces in terms of production volume. Canada is also active in the trade of fresh mushrooms: around 30 percent of fresh mushrooms produced in Canada in 2018 were exported.
