 In 2019, the population of Luxembourg amounted to nearly 614,000 people. Of these 614,000, nearly 309,000 were male. The female population reached just over 305,000, meaning women in Luxembourg were the minority that year. Population and age When looking at the average age of the Luxembourgish population, it shows that the largest share of people fell in the age brackets between 25 and 55 years old, with those between 35 and 39 forming the largest age group in the Grand Duchy. Only 766 people were 95 years and older. Home to all Luxembourg is home to a large foreign population. In 2019, nearly 48 percent of the people who live in the country were citizens of another state. That year, most of the foreign citizens came from other European countries. 724 people from Central America also called the Grand Duchy home, as did roughly 2,700 North Americans. In addition, there were also nearly 185,000 frontier workers employed in Luxembourg.
