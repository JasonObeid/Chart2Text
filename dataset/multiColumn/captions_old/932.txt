 This statistic presents the market share of the main channels of distribution of general insurance personal lines in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2012 to 2018. Many insurance companies employ a variety of different channels to offer and distribute their products. In addition to agents and brokers, these attached to a particular company or these working independently, a multitude of other institutions offer insurance products for purchase, such as affinity groups (i.e. car dealers), banks, building societies and other outlets. Also, insurance products can be purchased directly from the insurance company, which is made easier than ever by the digital technology. Insurtech is the buzz word in this area, as some of the technological advances being developed address either the calculation of the personalized premium to sell or the aggregation of information about products to simplify client decisions. As data presented by the source showed, in 2018, the majority of personal lines of general insurance in the United Kingdom were purchased directly from the insurers (48 percent of the market) and further 33 percent were purchased from independent intermediaries.
