 This graph shows the average speed of all vehicles on all roads in Great Britain in 2014. Motorbikes, cars and light goods vehicles always have the highest speed limits which is why their average speeds are higher. Motorcycles tended to be the fastest vehicles especially on dual and single carriageways and 40 mph built-up roads. Buses and coaches were generally the slowest vehicles, often travelling a fair amount under their speed limit.
