 With forecasted unit shipments of 2.2 million in 2019, Sony is expected to retain its title as the world’s largest vendor of VR devices. Oculus, HTC are some of the other major players in the VR device market, with each controlling a relatively significant portion of the total market share, but still lagging far behind Sony in terms of shipments. The Virtual Reality Market In addition to the hardware segment, which mainly encompasses the manufacture and sale of VR headset devices, the VR market also includes a sizable software segment. Gaming companies are eager to incorporate VR technology into their range of offerings, while other organizations are exploring the possibilities of the use of VR in more professional settings, such as healthcare and engineering. Virtual Reality Users Although the industry is exhibiting consistent growth, VR devices have not achieved the same levels of widespread popularity attained by some other consumer electronics devices, possibly due to their currently limited usage options. Despite this, a significant portion of U.S.-based young adults state that they intend to purchase some sort of virtual or augmented reality device, and user satisfaction rate of VR/AR devices is also relatively high.
