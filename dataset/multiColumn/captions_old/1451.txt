 This statistic represents the pass rate for practical driving tests taken in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2015/2016, distributed to show success rate by number of attempts and age group. For those aged 30 and under, it was third time lucky as the highest pass rates for the 16-20 and 21-30 age groups were on the third attempt. In the older age groups, the highest pass rates were observed on the first attempt at the car practical test.
