 This statistic illustrates the market share of grocery stores in Great Britain from August 2012 to August 2019. In the 12 weeks to August 11, 2019, Tesco's market share stood at 27 percent. Compared to a corresponding period in previous years, Tesco has progressively lost its share, while the discounters Aldi and Lidl have both gained share every year over the same 12 week periods. Prior to the popularity of the discounters, the grocery retail market was dominated by the 'big four' supermarkets: Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons. On the back of the economic recession and an inflation, however, consumer behavior has shifted in favor of cheaper alternatives and discount supermarkets. The resulting 'price wars' has led to supermarkets lowering their prices and the highest share of food volume sales on promotion in Europe. Crucially, this has caused increased volatility in the grocery retail market and, as of January 2017, Aldi overtook the Co-operative to become the fifth largest supermarket in the UK.
