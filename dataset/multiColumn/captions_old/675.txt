 North America is forecast to be the region with the most 5G connections made using wearable devices in 2022. The 439 million connections in North America would be 222 million more than those made to 4G networks in 2017. Wearables used in North America and Asia Pacific are together forecast to account for around 70 percent of the wearable 5G connections worldwide in 2022. Wearable popularity in North America and Asia Pacific The growth of the wearables market in North America is highlighted by figures that expect 25 percent of the adult population in the United States to be using a wearable device by 2022. Ownership of wearables in Asia Pacific regions is already high among those living in China, Thailand, and Vietnam. These regional trends mirror developments within the global market that forecast shipments of wearables to reach more than 300 million by 2023. Create more possibilities by connecting devices Wearable devices are electronic devices fitted with sensors that can be worn on the body or carried as an accessory. Some are used for a singular purpose, such as fitness trackers, which are used to monitor the personal health of an individual; however, by connecting a wearable device to Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or even a cellular network, it can perform many more tasks. For instance, a smartwatch and a smartphone can work together via a Bluetooth connection to enable the user to receive notifications and messages on their smartwatch – a function that ranked highest among users in the United States.
