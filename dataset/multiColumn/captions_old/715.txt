 The largest single segment of the global accessible railway market is railway services, which is expected to have an average annual value of 38 billion euros in the period between 2021 and 2023. However, when taken as a whole, rolling stock manufacturing is the largest segment with a combined expected value of 43 billion euros per year over the same period. Accessible market The accessible railway market refers to the portion of the overall railway supply market that is open to bids from international suppliers. This can be split into four broad areas: signaling systems, railway infrastructure, services such as engineering, consulting and maintenance, and the manufacture of various kinds of trains and locomotives (rolling stock). Excluded from the railway supply market are rail operators, although this function is sometimes outsourced by governments. The total railway supply market (including those areas not open for international competition) is estimated at 185 billion euros. Total railway marketEurope has the largest accessible railway market, being slightly larger than the value of the American and Asian markets combined. This is due largely to the need to maintain the extensive existing rail network in the more developed European countries, which comprise a significant proportion of the global railway track given the area’s smaller geographic size relative to countries like Canada, China, Russia and the United States. However, investment in new large-scale rail projects exists mainly outside of Europe, with most of the ten-largest projects being located in the Asia Pacific region.
