 This statistic shows the percentage of adults in England who held a full car driving license in 1975/76, 1985/6, 1989/91, 1992/94, 1995/97, 1998/00 and between 2002 and 2017. While the percentage of male driving license holders has always been greater than that of female driving license holders, the gap between the two decreased significantly from 40 percent to 11 percent between 1975/76 and 2018. It is also worth noting that the percentage of all adults carrying driving licenses has basically remained stable since 2002, with smaller variations, ranging from 70 to 75 percent.
