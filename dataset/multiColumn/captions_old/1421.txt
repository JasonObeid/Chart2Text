 The load factor for electricity generation from both small scale and large-scale hydropower in UK has fluctuated since 2010. In 2018, the load factor of small-scale hydro decreased from the previous year to 37 percent. Load factors were typically lower for large scale hydro, except in 2015. Load factors are the ratio of how much electricity was produced as a share of the total generating capacity. Role of hydropower in the energy mix In 2018, hydropower accounted for approximately five percent of renewable electricity generation in the UK, generating 5,464 gigawatt-hours of electricity. Most of this was produced by large scale hydro. However, generation from small scale hydro has increased significantly since 2010. Scottish hydropower With its high levels of rainfall, mountains and lakes, Scotland unsurprisingly accounts for more than 80 percent of the hydroelectric resources in the UK. The cumulative capacity of hydropower in Scotland reached 1,655 megawatts in 2018. In comparison, the installed capacity in England was just 44 megawatts in the same year.
