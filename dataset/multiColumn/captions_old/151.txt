 Although the United Kingdom was supposed to leave the European Union on March 29,2019, the deal which Theresa May secured proved so unpopular it was rejected by the House of Commons three times between January and March 2019. As a result, Brexit has been delayed leading to frustration among many leave voters, especially among those that support a no-deal Brexit. A survey conducted in October 2019 indicated that support for a no-deal Brexit stood at 34 percent of people in Great Britain Effects of a no-deal Brexit A no-deal Brexit would have profound economic, political and logistical consequences for both Britain and the European Union. According to a forecast from the Bank of England there could be an 8 percent loss to gross-domestic product and an increase in the unemployment rate of 7.5 percent, while Inflation could rise by as much as 6.5 percent and house prices may decline by 30 percent. Ports could be worst hit The port of Dover is the UK’s vital link to the continent, separated by just 20 miles of water from Calais in France. Due to Britain’s membership of and single market, custom checks at Dover take an average of just 2 minutes, as of 2018 resulting in traffic queues that are usually about 10 miles long. Should Britain leave the EU without a deal, there is a fear that these custom checks could increase, with even a 4 minute customs check resulting in queues almost 40 miles in length.
