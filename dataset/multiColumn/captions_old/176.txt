 In 2018, Adidas had a net income of 1.7 billion euros, in comparison Puma’s net income amounted to 83.3 million euros. Adidas and Puma are two of the largest and most recognizable sports companies in the world. Both companies hold a noteworthy volume share of the highly fragmented and saturated clothing and apparel market. Background of Adidas & Puma Both sporting goods manufacturers originate from Germany. Adidas and Puma used to be one company named Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik (Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory), established by two brothers, Adolf and Rudolf Dassler in the 1920s. 24 years after the foundation of this company, the Dassler brothers separated over an argument, leading to the creation of two distinct companies. Adolf Dassler set up Adidas, while his brother Rudolf established Puma. Since then, both companies have developed into multinational companies, generating billions of euros in revenues annually. They remain strong competitors, as both design and manufacture footwear, apparel, and accessories. How do these companies compare with market leader Nike? Surprisingly, Nike’s net income is on a similar level with that of adidas as it fell significantly between 2017 and 2018 to just under two billion U.S. dollars. Nike is the world's leading athletic apparel brand, dwarfing their nearest competitor adidas in terms of brand value.
