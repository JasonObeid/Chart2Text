 This graph shows the expenditure of the so-called super PACs in the United States up to November 20, 2012. Super PACs are independent expenditure-only committees, which may raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions, associations and individuals, then spend unlimited sums to overtly advocate for or against political candidates. However, direct coordination and communication between political candidates and super PACs is prohibited. Each of the candidates in the 2012 election was supported by at least one super PAC. Mitt Romney was supported by the super PAC "Restore Our Future" which has expended nearly 143 million U.S. dollars to support him, up to November 20, 2012.
