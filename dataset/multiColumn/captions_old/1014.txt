In 2017, the total population of Spain was around 46.33 million people and was forecast to decrease by 2023. Multiple reasons behind this decline There are two reasons for the decline in Spain’s population. First, more people died in Spain than there were being born in 2017. According to data provided from the Spanish Statistics Institute, there were over 420 thousand deaths versus 390 thousand newborns that year. Second, Spain’s population moved away from the country in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Germany was the preferred destination chosen by Spanish expats, with a share of 17 percent of the total amount of Spaniards living abroad.
