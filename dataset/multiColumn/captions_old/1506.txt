 Between 2011 and 2016, the sales of smartphones in France have continuously been increasing, from about 11.5 million units to almost 22 million in 2018. On the other hand, the sales of laptops have been stagnating since 2012, while tablet sales peaked at 6.2 million units in 2014. Moreover, we can see that wearables have appeared on the French market for mobile devices since 2014: these body-borne devices are small computing devices which extend the performances of computing technologies. Digital devices usage in France In average, half of French people stated spending from two to four hours on their mobile devices (smartphone, tablet or computer) in a survey from 2019. Furthermore, the share of people using their smartphone to conduct various activities such as online purchases has increased in the past years, reaching almost 30 percent by 2018. However, a high proportion of French people also seem to consider themselves as addicted to their devices, especially young adults aged 18 to 34 years old. Connected wearables usage in France Nevertheless, about a fifth of interviewed in 2017 intended to buy a connected device in the future: 19 percent mentioned a connected bracelet or watch to track and display physical activity. This example of wearable usage appears to broaden across French society, since about the same proportion of respondents (20 percent) stated in 2019 using devices allowing them to monitor their heart rate or perspiration when doing sports.
