 The volume of coal produced from deep mining has fallen considerably since 1970. In that year, 136.6 million metric tons was produced, but by 2018 this had fallen to just 7,390 metric tons. Production volumes since 2015 have been higher from surface mining than deep mining. Death of an industry As production has decreased, so have the number of mines. In 2000, deep mine numbers stood at 33, but in less than 20 years this number had fallen to just 3. This in turn has affected employment numbers. Historically the coal industry has been a major powerhouse of the UK’s economy, employing more than one million individuals in 1920. By 2017 the number of employees was just 1,000, showing a shift away from the fossil fuel. Coal in the energy mix The reliance on coal in the UK’s energy mix has plummeted since 2012, and in 2017 its share was just 6.7 percent. This has coincided with the increase in renewable electricity generation, which overtook coal for the first time in 2015. In May 2019, Britain went one week without coal power, the first time this had happened since 1882.
