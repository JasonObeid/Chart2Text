 In 2017, the average biking distance per person per day amounted to approximately 2.5 and 2.3 kilometers for men and women respectively. In terms of the average biking distance by age, children between 12 to 18 years old cycled 5.6 kilometers, the longest distance in 2017. Furthermore, people aged 25 to 35 years had the lowest average kilometers with roughly two thousand meters a day. Increasing demand for electric bicycles Examining the distance cycled, it decreased from 2015 onwards. A similar trend can be seen with the sales volume of new bicycles. If in 2007 the sales volume amounted to 1.4 million bicycles, in 2017 it decreased to roughly 960,000 bikes. Although overall sales declined, the demand for electric bikes grew. In 2017, roughly 30 percent of all newly sold bicycles were electric, a growth of nearly 25 percentage points in ten years. 42 percent were city bikes but compared to 2007, it is a decrease of roughly 20 percent. Nevertheless, these types of bicycles remain having the highest share of the total new bicycle sales in the Netherlands in 2017. Turnover increase in bicycle retail Despite the decline in sales volume of new bicycles, the total turnover of bicycle retail saw an increase between 2015 and 2017. In 2015, the turnover amounted to roughly 1.2 billion euros, whereas in 2017 more than 1.25 billion euros was generated by the bicycle retail industry.
