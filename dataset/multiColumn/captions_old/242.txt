 China was the leading graphite producing country worldwide as of 2019. In that year they produced an estimated 700,000 metric tons of graphite. Graphite’s end-uses Graphite is an allotrope of carbon that is comprised of layers of carbon atoms. These layers can slide over each other easily, making it a very soft mineral. It is dull grey in appearance and metallic in luster. It conducts electricity easily because there are electrons between the layers of carbon atoms. Under high pressures and temperatures, graphite turns into diamonds. This process is actually how synthetic diamonds are produced. Due to its high conductivity, graphite is used in electrodes, batteries, and solar panels. Some other uses include being used in pencils (as it is well known as ‘pencil lead’), and lubricants. Graphite was first used during the Neolithic Age as a paint. Since it was discovered in England around the year 1565, the use of graphite has increased. Graphite mining worldwide In 2019, the total worldwide production volume of graphite was an estimated 1.1 million metric tons. Even though China is world’s leading producer of graphite, the country’s graphite reserves are second-largest worldwide. The country with the largest volume of graphite reserves in the world is Turkey. In 2019, they had approximately 90 million metric tons of natural graphite reserves. China accounts for the highest share of the United States’ graphite imports, accounting for a 37 percent share of total U.S. graphite imports between 2014 and 2017.
