 Ernst and Young (EY) generated revenue of 36.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2019, almost half of which came from the Americas region. The next largest share of revenue was generated from the geographic area of Europe, the Middle East, India, and Africa (EMEIA). Rising revenues The combined worldwide revenue of EY continues to increase year-on-year, assisted by significant growth in the Americas region – revenue for the region has almost doubled since 2010. Revenue streams also continue to rise across all four of the firm’s service lines: assurance, advisory, tax, and transaction advisory services. Interest in the firm’s advisory service line remains high as it helps clients to identify and manage issues in growth areas such as analytics and cybersecurity. The transaction advisory service line reported the biggest year-on-year growth between 2018 and 2019, increasing by 15 percent. Service with a smile The accountancy profession is part of the tertiary sector of the economy, which focuses solely on providing services to customers. Working under the name of a single brand – such as EY – many independent accounting firms join forces to create a professional services network. EY employed over 284,000 people worldwide in 2019, each providing specialist knowledge from their own branch of accounting. Around 94,000 of those employees worked in the assurance service line and were primarily tasked with auditing the financial records of clients to a high quality.
