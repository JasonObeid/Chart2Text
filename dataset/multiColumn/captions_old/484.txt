 Gmail and Hotmail (Outlook.com) were still the most used email services in the Netherlands, according to survey respondents in 2018. Compared to earlier years, the use of both Google’s as well as Microsoft’s free e-mail service saw an increase in their usage among Dutch consumers, whilst e-mail services provided by domestic providers (such as KPN and Ziggo) saw much less use. Sending and receiving e-mails is a popular online communication method across all age groups in the country. E-mail in the Netherlands is more than personal communication or business contacts E-mail in the Netherlands is deemed to be a more diverse communication channel than social media. For example, Dutch consumers enjoy subscribing to e-mail newsletters or mailings. The main reason for this is to receive a notification of a discount or a special offer from, for example, an online store. Interest in a particular brand or organization is also an important driver behind e-mail subscriptions. Dutch consumers more likely to click on marketing e-mails International marketeers who approach consumers via e-mail are more likely to succeed when approaching potential Dutch customers than when approaching potential customers from other European countries. In the first quarter of 2018, marketing e-mails in the Netherlands reached the highest click-through rate of all European countries.
