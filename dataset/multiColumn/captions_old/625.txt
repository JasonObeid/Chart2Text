 Ridesharing platform, Uber has been increasing the gender diversity of its workforce, which was 59.1 percent male and 40.9 percent female as of March 2019. Ridesharing company employees The above figures only refer to staff that are employed directly by Uber, and do not include drivers. Controversially, Uber take the view that their drivers are independent contractors, rather than company employees. The same is true for their main competitor in the U.S. market - Lyft. This means that drivers need to pay for all operating costs out of their earnings, such vehicle maintenance and insurance. Given that earnings for ridesharing drivers are generally between 15 and 20 U.S. dollars an hour, after expenses this can mean that drivers’ earnings are far below the minimum wage. Diversity in the ridesharing industry The gender diversity of Uber’s employees is similar to that of Lyft, whose workforce is 60 percent male and 40 percent female. Lyft has a higher portion of women in leadership roles though – 32.8 percent compared to Uber’s 28 percent. In terms of ethnic diversity, Uber’s workforce is more diverse than that of Lyft .
