 In 2018, Samsung was the biggest smartphone brand in the Netherlands with a market share of close to 40 percent. This is a decrease compared to the previous year. Second in the Netherlands was Apple. These two brands together took up almost 75 percent of the total market. Chinese Huawei experienced an increase in market share between 2017 and 2018. It is unclear whether this stayed the same in 2019, as the source discontinued its research into the topic. The number of smartphone users in the Netherlands reached around 15 million people in 2018, whereas the country’s smartphone penetration rate was at roughly 88 percent that year. Which smartphone model is the most popular in the Netherlands? In early 2018, the most-owned smartphones in the Netherlands were relatively old iPhones. The Apple iPhone 5 was the most popular smartphone then, followed by the iPhone 6, 6s and SE. The newest Samsung Galaxy model back then, the S7, was the most popular Android smartphone. Who uses smartphones the most? As of 2017, roughly 99 percent of the individuals in the Netherlands aged 13 to 19 years old indicated they used a smartphone to access the Internet. This was significantly higher than, for example, 50- to 64-year-olds, of which 80 percent accessed the Internet through a smartphone.
