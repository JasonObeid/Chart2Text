Approximately 7.2 patients were on the organ transplant waiting list for a kidney, followed by far by patients that were on the list for a liver, who amounted to slightly under two thousand.

Doctors also performed a total of approximately 1.2 thousand liver transplants, 321 heart transplants, 369 lung transplants, 82 pancreas transplants and six intestinal transplants. Organ donation can be given through both a deceased and living donor if blood and oxygen are flowing through the organs until the time of recovery to ensure viability. Spain: leader in organ donation In 2017, Spain had the highest rate of deceased donors in Europe. The rate of organ donation, including donation after brain death (DBD) and after cardiac death (DCD), was 47 per million population. Luxembourg experienced the largest increase in the rate of organ donation between 2016 and 2017, going from 5.2 to 15 donors per million population. Croatia, on the other hand, suffered quite a significant drop in organ donation in 2017 relative to the previous year, but it still had the third highest rate of deceased organ donation in Europe.
