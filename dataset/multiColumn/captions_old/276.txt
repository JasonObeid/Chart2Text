 In 2019, Airbus took gross orders for 1,131 aircraft. This compares to 246 gross orders received by Boeing, a decline of almost 80 percent compared to 2018. In 2019, Boeing's customers made contractual changes to some 192 orders, bringing the number of net orders down to only 54 jets - and this is after factoring in conversions from previous years (due to contractual cancellations and adjustments made in response to the ASC 606 revenue recognition standard, Boeing's net orders excluding conversions and cancellations came to a negative 87 units). The slump in orders means that the company's book-to-bill ratio dropped to a negative 0.23. Boeing's deliveries stood at 380 units. Airbus and Boeing Boeing and Airbus are ranked as the two leading aircraft manufacturers worldwide. Both companies have produced highly successful jet models, including the Airbus A320 and Boeing’s 737 aircraft, which was often named as one of the best-selling jets worldwide before coming under scrutiny for falling short of safety standards. The Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner and the Airbus A350-1000 are some of the two company’s most recent models, respectively. Both the Airbus A350 and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner are wide-bodied two-engined jet airliners that are powered by Rolls Royce Trent engines, although some 787 aircraft also sport General Electric’s GEnx (next generation) engines. General Electric and Rolls Royce are counted among the leading aircraft engine manufacturers globally. The 787 Dreamliner is the first commercial aircraft to use lithium-ion batteries: A new technology that has its flaws. In 2013, the entire Dreamliner fleet was grounded after the batteries, which are supplied by Japan’s GS Yuasa Corporation, were linked to a number of severe fires. The National Transportation Safety Board of the United States blames the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Boeing, as well as the two suppliers Thales and GS Yuasa for falling short in their roles to monitor safety and quality of the aircraft and its parts. Despite the manufacturer's woes, new orders for the 787 remain strong. In November 2019, Emirates updated its order book and placed 30 orders for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
