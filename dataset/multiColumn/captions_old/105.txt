 In the past decade, China has been shifting from the cheap labor driven economy to the more matured, service-oriented markets and industries. While the economy continues to grow, prices, cost of living, and wages keep on increasing as well. How do wages differ across the country? China’s provinces and cities are divided into districts of different levels. Most provinces set different minimum wages for different districts depending on the cost of living and level of development. Usually, provincial capitals and major cities enjoy higher hourly wages than smaller towns and rural areas of the same province. In 2018, the highest minimum hourly wages in China were in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin municipalities with 24, 21, and 20.8 yuan respectively, whereas employees in Hunan and Yunnan provinces who received a minimum wage were paid the least – between 11.6 and 15 yuan per hour. Minimum monthly wages that year were the highest in Shanghai and the lowest in Chongqing. The average annual salary in urban China was around 74,300 yuan in 2017. What are the prospects? Regional governments in China must update their minimum wages at least every few years. Fujian, Hunan, Gansu, Guizhou, Tianjin, Qinghai, and Zhejiang – provinces and municipalities that have not adjusted minimum wages in the past two years – are likely to do so in 2019. Along with economic development, increasing living standards, increasing prices and a shrinking labor force, overall minimum wages will likely continue growing in China.
