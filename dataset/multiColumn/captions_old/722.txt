 Retail sales of beer, wine and liquor stores reached approximately 2.01 billion Canadian dollars in February 2019, an increase of around 80 million Canadian dollars compared to February in the previous year. Monthly sales have witnessed a steady increase over the past five years. Of these beverages, wine is the most popular among Canadians, followed by domestic and imported beer. Canadian liquor laws Canada has complex liquor laws which have developed since Prohibition in the 1920s. Throughout Canada’s provinces and territories, there are 13 different organizations responsible for regulating the sale and distribution of alcohol. It is mostly the case that there are provincially owned stores who have a monopoly over spirit sales. In some provinces it is possible to buy a limited selection of spirits, wine or beer in privately owned shops or grocery stores. Alcohol consumption trends in Canada According to a survey, consumers living in the Canadian province of Quebec drink the most frequently, with 57 percent of respondents stating that they drink alcohol at least once a week. This figure decreases to 28 percent in Atlantic Canada. It appears that political party preference also effects alcohol intake, with those supporting the Liberal party most likely to drink at least once a week.
