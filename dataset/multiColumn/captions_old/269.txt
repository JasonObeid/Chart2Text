 Before the banknotes enter circulation, they must pass the production tests, related to the quality of notes and security of the money. Many factors influence the length of time a banknote stays in circulation, including the overall durability, but also non-altered signals in automated authentication, for security. The lifespan of notes can also vary for different denominations, as some are more frequently used in making payments. If a banknote no longer meets quality standards, it needs to be taken out of the market.
