Why do gas prices fluctuate? Crude oil prices, along with changing levels of consumer demand, are the two main factors which directly affect retail gasoline prices. Prices can witness a rapid increase or decrease if something impacts crude oil supplies, refinery operations or pipeline deliveries. Even if crude prices remain steady, seasonal changes in demand can still affect prices. Price breakdown Gasoline prices are made up of a number of different costs. In 2017, the average cost per liter was 114.6 Canadian cents. In that year, crude cost accounted for the largest portion of the average price of gasoline in Canada, totaling some 43.4 Canadian cents per liter.
