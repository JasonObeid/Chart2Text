 This statistic shows the global impact of mosquito-borne diseases in 2015. In that year, around 3.4 billion people around the globe were at risk of contracting malaria. Mosquito-borne diseases-additional information Although the at-risk population for malaria remained high in 2015, the number of malaria cases worldwide decreased in all parts of the world from 2000 to 2015. In total, the world saw a decrease of malaria cases from 262,000 in the year 2000 to 214,000 in the year 2015. Africa, the region with the most cases of Malaria, saw a decrease over the same period from 214,000 to 188,000. In a worldwide survey of global travelers Malaria was found to be the third most concerning health risk for travelers, with insect-borne fevers, such as Dengue ranking number two behind Ebola. The latest outbreak of the Zika virus in South and Central America also shows the challenge of fighting mosquito-borne diseases. The Zika virus has been linked to a rise in microcephaly among newborns, a neurodevelopmental disorder which ultimately can result in severely impaired intellectual development and other neurological dysfunctions such as hyperactivity, convulsions, etc. As of 2015, over two million people worldwide were living in areas environmentally suitable for Zika virus transmission, with Asia accounting for 1.4 million of the at-risk population. In 2015 alone, mosquitoes were responsible for 755,000 human deaths, making them the most deadly creatures worldwide, far ahead of the second most deadly creature, snails, with 200,000 human deaths.
