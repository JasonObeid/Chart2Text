 This statistic shows the forecasted annual change in rental prices in London (UK) between 2018 and 2022, as of 2018. The changes in regulations and housing policies, which were introduced in 1980 in the United Kingdom, had far-reaching impact on the structure of the housing sector and its subsectors, such as private home ownership, social housing, private rented housing and other. As a result of these changes, there was a shift away from home ownership and towards the private home rental part of the market. Private renting became prevalent, both out of need (i.e. more difficult access to affordable housing for first-time buyers, undersupply of homes etc.) and out of choice. The necessity of mapping the expected dynamics in rental prices became visible, to help to define trends on the ever-changing market. As the forecast for different districts of London shows, rental prices in the Greater London area for the whole period from 2018 to 2022 were expected to grow by 10.9 percent, whereas in Prime Central London the growth was expected to be three percent.
