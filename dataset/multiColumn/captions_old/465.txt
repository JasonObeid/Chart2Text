Regionally, growth in the number of clients seeking auditing advice in Europe led to revenue from the auditing service line in the EMA increasing to around 4.85 billion U.S dollars in 2019. The decade of the merger The accounting industry experienced a period of significant change during the 1980s, as eight firms sought ways to gain advantages in new international markets. Peat Marwick International (PMI) was one member of the Big Eight looking for ways to meet the growing global demand for professional services; Klynveld Main Goerdeler (KMG) was a smaller firm operating outside of the Big Eight and struggling to make an impression. In 1987, the two firms agreed to a merger that made strategic sense to both and immediately made the newly formed KPMG the largest accounting firm in the world. As competition for international clients intensified, two further mega mergers took place at the end of an extraordinary decade in the accounting industry, as the Big Eight became the Big Six in 1989.
