This stems from the high numbers of immigrants to the U.S. throughout the country’s history, with many people coming to America in search of a better life and more opportunities. This search for opportunity became known as the “American Dream”, and the country became a “melting pot” of different nationalities, cultures, and traditions. Looking to the future Currently, the United States is the third most populous country in the world, and its population is only expected to increase. It is forecast that the U.S. population will show steady growth over the next 40 years, and by 2060, the population of the U.S. is expected to be over 400 million people.
