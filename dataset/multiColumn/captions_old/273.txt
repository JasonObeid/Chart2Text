The world's leading container ship operators In terms of capacity, the world's largest container ship operators include France's CMA CGM, Swiss-based Mediterranean Shipping Company and Denmark's Maersk Line.

Copenhagen-based AP Moeller-Maersk was founded in 1904. While Maersk is active in various fields, the company’s largest business area is the container shipping area, which operates under the company's ocean unit. In 2019, Maersk generated around 39 billion U.S. dollars in revenue, some 28 billion U.S. dollars of which were derived from the group’s ocean segment. As of March 2, 2020 Maersk’s container ship fleet had a capacity of around 4.2 million twenty-foot equivalent units of capacity. Furthermore, the container line had ships with an additional 39,864 twenty-foot-equivalent units of capacity in its order book. One of Maersk’s most impressive container ships is the Magleby Maersk. The Triple-E vessel was built by South Korea’s Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Company in 2014, one of the largest shipbuilding companies worldwide. The gargantuan cargo ship is 400 meters long, 59 meters wide and 73 meters high. The ships in the triple-E class are at the vanguard of a trend towards increasingly larger ships, although the container shipping-industry continues to suffer from overcapacity and weak global demand. Hamburg Süd was acquired by APM Maersk in 2017 to power Maersk Line's growth strategy looking forward.
