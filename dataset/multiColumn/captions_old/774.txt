 This statistic displays the average percentage change on previous year of rent increase including and excluding rent harmonization in the Netherlands in 2019, by type of rental. Rent harmonization means rent increase may exceed the maximum increased valid for that year when a dwelling changes tenancy. This new increase can be applied at any moment in time and is not connected to the annual rent increase on July 1st in the Netherlands. The rent after harmonization however, may not exceed the maximum rent based on the Ministry of Interior and Kingdom Relations' Rent Point System. It shows that in 2019 the average rent, rent harmonization included, in the Netherlands increased by 2.5 percent when compared to the previous year. In the first quarter of 2019, the average housing rent in the Netherlands increased to reach a value of 16.33 euros per square meter whilst the average rent in the city of Amsterdam reached a value of approximately 23.28 euros per square meter. The European housing, or residential real estate, market has recently shown clear signs of recovery, with an increasing house price being the main trend.
