 In 2019, Russian mines produced approximately 19 million carats of diamonds, making it the world's largest natural industrial diamond producer that year. What are industrial diamonds? Industrial diamonds are diamonds that are valued for their extreme level of hardness, but which have either many flaws or irregular shapes and therefore are not aesthetically valuable. For this reason, they are used for industrial purposes. They usually have many flaws and have an irregular shape. Overall, industrial diamonds have a low value as gems, but they are important in the mining and metalworking industries. They are used for cutting materials as well as polishing other materials including diamonds. They are also sometimes used for drill bits, saws, and as an abrasive. Comparative diamond production volumes The production volume of industrial synthetic/lab grown diamonds worldwide has stayed about the same since 2007. In 2016, the global production of industrial diamonds was about 4.41 billion carats. The production of natural diamonds is expected to remain the same from 2015 to 2025, at around 100 million carats. For synthetic industrial diamond production, a forecasted five billion carats is expected in 2025. The largest diamond producing country in 2018 was Russia, and secondly Australia. In that year Australia produced about 17 million carats of diamonds. The total global production of rough diamonds amounted to 142 million carats in 2019.
