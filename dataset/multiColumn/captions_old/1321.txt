 Throughout this period the European Union was the key source of anthracite coal to the United Kingdom, with imports peaking in 2013 at 109,000 metric tons. The following year imports from the EU dropped to 42,000 metric tons, and by 2017 Russia emerged as the main exporter. Anthracite is the highest ranking of coal. It is often referred to as hard coal and has the highest carbon content and energy density of all types of coal. It also has a higher quality when compared to normal coal. Coal types Whilst the EU was the main provider of anthracite to the UK, the regions exports of coking coal paled in comparison to Australia and the United States. Australia was the main exporter of this form of coal, exporting more than four million metric tons in 2002. However, imports from Australia began to decrease annually from 2012, and by 2018 the country was exporting less than Russia. Russia is the leading exporter of steam coal to the UK. From 2013 to 2016, imports from Russia fell from 19 million metric tons to just 1.6 million. Despite this decline, there was a recovery in the following years with imports rising to 3.8 million metric tons. Coal consumption The consumption of coal for energy use in the United Kingdom has fallen significantly in recent decades. In 1980, consumption was increased to 120.8 million metric tons of oil equivalent, but by 2018 it had fallen to a low of 8.5 million metric tons of oil equivalent. As of 2018, coal made up just 7.64 percent of the average UK fuel mix.
