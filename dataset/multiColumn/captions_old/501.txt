 The population in Sweden has been increasing at a steady pace for several years. At the end of 2019, the population in Sweden amounted to 10.33 million inhabitants. Among them, 5.2 million were men and 5.13 million were women. The case that the Swedish population consisted of a higher number of men than women occurred in March 2015 for the first time and has been like that since. More births than deaths One reason for the increasing population in Sweden is partly due to the fact that the number of babies that are born each year, are higher than the number of individuals that deceases. More immigrants than emmigrants However, the main reason for the increasing population in Sweden is not due to the higher number of births than deaths, but to the positive immigration flow that has been consistent over the last decade. In 2018 the migration balance in Sweden was around 86 thousand more individuals arriving than leaving.
