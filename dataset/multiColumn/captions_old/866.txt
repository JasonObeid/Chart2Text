 This statistic displays the value of business-to-business (B2B, including-business-to-government or B2G) and business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce sales via website in the United Kingdom from 2014 to 2018. In 2018, sales to private customers (B2C) amounted to 199.7 billion British pounds. This is an increase of over 70 billion British pounds since 2017. For this statistic only sales made by companies with ten or more employees were counted. Companies with less employees accounted for 14.6 Billion pounds in B2C website sales in 2017. The data is available as a breakdown of sales by company size. This additional data shows that most of the sales in B2C are generated by companies with over 1,000 employees. When looking at B2B and B2G sales companies with 250 to 999 employees generate the most sales but companies with 1,000 employees generate almost as much value. Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) sales are not included in the data presented. A comparison between website sales and EDI sales can be found here.
