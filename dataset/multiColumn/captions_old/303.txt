 This statistic illustrates the share of buyers who have bought cars in the last two years prior to the survey and, of those, what percentage bought second-hand cars, based on a survey carried out in the United Kingdom (UK) in late March 2015. The survey organizes the participants in various groups by age and gender The age group with the largest proportion of respondents who had bought a new car was 55 to 64 years, and for used cars this was the 35 to 44 age group. The age group with the smallest proportion of respondents, who had bought a new car was 17-24 of age and the group with the smallest share of respondents, who had bought a used car in the last two years was of the age of 65 and up. According to the survey, both men and women bought more often a used car in the last two years than they did buy a new car. Overall the respondents of the survey state that they rather buy a used car than a new car. Of all respondents only nine percent stated that they bought a new car instead of choosing a used one.
