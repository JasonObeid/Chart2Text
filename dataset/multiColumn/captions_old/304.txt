 Global energy consumption has increased dramatically in recent years and is projected to continue to increase. By 2040 renewable energy consumption is expected to increase and will reach about 2,748 metric tons of oil. In comparison, the total renewable energy consumption totalled 35.02 metric tons of oil in 1990. Energy Consumption The distribution of energy consumption globally is disproportionately high among some countries. In 2017, China, the U.S., and India were the largest consumers of primary energy globally. On a per capita basis, however, the data looks a bit different. As of 2015, Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait were among the countries with the highest per capita energy consumption. Spotlight: Renewable Energy Consumption Renewable energy includes solar energy, wind power, hydroelectric energy, biomass and geothermal power, to name a few. Over the last 20 years or so renewable energy consumption has increased dramatically. Recent data suggests that renewable energy is growing as a share of the primary energy consumption worldwide. Among all countries globally, China has installed the most renewable energy capacity as of 2018.
