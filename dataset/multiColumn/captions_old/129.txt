 Norway is the most successful nation of all time at the Winter Olympic Games, having amassed a total of 368 medals since the first Winter Olympics in 1924 – this tally includes 132 gold medals, 125 silver, and 111 bronze. This total is especially impressive considering the Scandinavian country has a population of just over five million inhabitants. Norway dominate the medals Given Norway’s dominance at the top of the overall medal table, it comes as no surprise that the three most successful Winter Olympians of all time come from Norway. The cross-country skier, Marit Bjorgen, sits at the very top of the list having bagged 15 medals across five Winter Olympics between 2002 and 2018. Her medal haul includes eight gold medals which she won across five different disciplines, including the skiathlon, the sprint and the 30km race. 2018 Winter Olympics The 2018 Winter Olympics took place in PyeongChang in South Korea, representing the first time that South Korea had held the Winter Olympics, although the country hosted the summer edition of the Games in Seoul in 1988. The 2018 Games comprised a record 102 events, marking an additional four events from the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. These events were held at a number of venues across PyeongChang, including the Phoenix Snow Park, the Gangneung Ice Arena, and the PyeongChang Olympic Stadium, which had a capacity of 35,000. True to form, Norway ended the Games top of the medals table, having claimed 39 medals in total, including 14 gold.
