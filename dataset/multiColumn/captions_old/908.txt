 This statistic shows volumes of coal imported and exported to and from the United Kingdom (UK) between 1970 and 2018. Net imports of coal to the UK fell sharply between 2014 and 2017, amounting to roughly 10.1 million metric tons in 2016. With the growth of renewable energy sources and gas, coal has become less used as a fuel for electricity generation.
