 In 2018, the poverty rate in the United States was highest among people between the ages of 18 and 24 years old, with a rate of 18.28 percent for male Americans and a rate of 23.1 percent for female Americans. The lowest poverty rate for both genders was found in individuals between the ages of 65 and 74 years old. What is the poverty line? The poverty line is a metric used by the U.S. Census Bureau to define poverty in the United States. It is a specific income level that is considered to be the bare minimum a person or family needs to meet their basic needs. If a family’s annual pre-tax income is below this income level, then they are considered poor. Living below the poverty line According to the most recent data, over one-fifth of African Americans in the United States live below the poverty line; the most out of any ethnic group. Additionally, over seven million families in the U.S. live in poverty – a figure that has held mostly steady since 1990.
