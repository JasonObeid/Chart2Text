 In 2018, almost half of India’s GDP was generated by the services sector, a slight and steady increase over the last 10 years. Among the leading services industries in the country are telecommunications, IT, and software. The IT factor The IT industry is a vital part of India’s economy, and in the fiscal year of 2016/2017, it generated about 8 percent of India’s GDP alone – a slight decrease from previous years, when it made up about 10 percent of the country’s economy. Nevertheless, the IT industry is growing, as is evident by its quickly increasing revenue and employment figures. IT includes software development, consulting, software management, and online services, and business process management (BPM). Employee migration Although employment figures in IT, and thus in the services sector, are on the rise, most of the Indian workforce is still employed in agriculture, however, the figures show a trend pointing towards a reversal of this distribution. For now, the majority of Indians still do not live in cities – where IT jobs are generated – but urbanization is on the rise as well.
