 The most frequent users of Spotify in the United States were revealed to be adults aged between 18 and 29 years old, with 21 percent saying that they listen to Spotify several times per day. This generation of young consumers has been quick to adopt Spotify and streaming technology in general, and is crucial for the success of these platforms. Older generations of consumers have been slower to integrate Spotify into their lives and a large majority of people over the age of 45 reported that they do not use the service. Spotify Streaming entertainment services have skyrocketed in popularity over the past decade, but very few have been as successful as Spotify. Since its launch in 2008, the Spotify platform has grown into the most widely used music streaming service in the world, accounting for over a third of the market’s total subscribers. Recent estimates place the service at over 100 million paying subscribers in addition to its countless free and ad-supported users. Given the company’s Swedish origins, it’s no surprise that Europe is Spotify’s strongest regional market with around 37 million monthly active users, but it has also managed to secure a strong presence in both the U.S. and Latin America. Music streaming Streaming has grown into one of the most successful entertainment platforms in the world, and as of 2018 accounted for around 75 percent of total music industry revenue. These services provide consumers with nearly unlimited access to their favorite songs, artists, and genres at the click of a button. In order to thrive in what is a highly competitive market; leading services like Spotify and Apple Music are constantly seeking to grow their music libraries, offer better music suggestions to their customers, and provide additional products like podcasts and audiobooks.
