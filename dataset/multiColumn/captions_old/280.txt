 It is projected that electricity generated by most energy sources worldwide, with the exception of liquids, will increase in the coming years. Electricity from renewable sources is expected to experience the largest growth of up to 21.66 trillion kilowatt hours in 2050, from almost 7 trillion kilowatt hours in 2018. This projection sees increased consumption from all fuel sources, except for coal, where demand seems to have plateaued. Conventional sources like coal are increasingly being replaced by natural gas, renewables, and nuclear power. What is the fastest growing resource? Renewable electricity generation has steadily increased over the past years and is expected to continue along this trend. Using the currently available renewable sources for electricity generation could supply a large majority of U.S. electricity generation in the near future. This supply would require increased electric system flexibility which could be provided through a variety of supply and demand options like flexible electricity generation from conventional sources, grid storage, and more responsible grids.
