 Between the 1st and 24th of February 2020, 999 migrants arrived in Italy by sea. In 2019, the number of migrants who stepped foot in Italy peaked in September 2019 at 2.5 thousand people. Between 2016 and 2019, the number of immigrants who reached Italian seashores decreased, reaching the lowest figures in 2019. The largest amount of people migrating to Italy were registered in the years 2016 and 2017. In October 2016, 27.4 thousand individuals reached the Italian coasts by crossing the Mediterranean Sea, the highest peak recorded in the past four years. The main ports of arrivals In 2018, the main port where migrants arrived was Pozzallo, a city in Sicily, in the South of Italy. Pozzallo is in the province of Ragusa, located directly on the Mediterranean Sea. The number of migrants who set foot in Pozzallo in 2018 amounted to 3.8 thousand people. In that year, the Island of Lampedusa was the second most important harbor for the arrivals. Almost 3.5 thousand migrants arrived on this Sicilian island. Lampedusa is only about 113 kilometers (70 miles) away from Tunisia and represents an important entry port for the whole of Europe. Asylum applications mostly denied In 2018, a total of 53.6 thousand asylum applications were registered in Italy. However, data on the examined requests show that asylum was denied in most of the cases. For instance, in 76 percent of the cases examined in October 2019, applicants were not given the asylum status. Only 11 percent of migrants received the refugee status during that month, whilst seven percent of people were assigned a subsidiary protection.
