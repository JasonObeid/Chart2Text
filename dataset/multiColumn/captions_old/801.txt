 This statistic shows the market share of the leading cloud infrastructure service providers from 2017 to 2019. In the second quarter of 2019, Amazon, via Amazon Web Services, held around 33 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market. Amazon's share of the cloud infrastructure services market has remained steady at around a third of the total market since at least 2014. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or cloud infrastructure services form one of the three core service models of the cloud computing market, along with platform as a service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). Within Infrastructure as a Service, a third party provides and maintains infrastructure components on behalf of its customers. Currently, cloud infrastructure services form the fastest growing sector of the cloud computing market, although Software as a Service is - and is expected to remain - the largest segment overall. Perhaps predictably, around half of the revenues for the global enterprise cloud computing market currently stem from North America, with Europe comprising another quarter of the market. However, the the cloud computing market is growing steadily around the globe.
