The distinctive red colored dress uniform of the RCMP, popularly referred to as Red Serge, was adopted from the Northwest Mounted Police and was styled in order to reflect the British character of the police force. The image and name of the RCMP was trademarked in 1995 with the intended purpose of preserving the image and reputation of the force. Proceeds from royalties collected are used to fund community initiative projects across Canada.
