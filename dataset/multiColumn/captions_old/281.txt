 Barclays is one of the ten largest banks in Europe in terms of total assets. It is also among the European banks with strongest international presence, operating in 50 countries worldwide. Number of employees in Barclays Group As of 2017, the Barclays group no longer had a core or non-core division as well as the discontinuation of its Africa banking division. The Barclays group now only reports under the international, UK and head office divisions. This is the main reason behind the huge increase in the number of full-time employees working at Barclays head office as of 2017. The fact is that Barclays has made a decrease in the number of full-time employees, with the UK alone seeing a cut of approximately 14.6 thousand between 2016 and 2019. Number of employees in Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland A similar decrease in employee headcount can also be observed in the Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland.
