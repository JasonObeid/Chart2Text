 Between 2008 and 2018, the migration balance in the Netherlands was positive every year, meaning that more people settled in the Netherlands than leaving for newer pastures. In 2018, the migration balance was nearly 86,400, the highest number in the past decade. In 2018, the number of people in the Netherlands with a migration background (defined as someone who has at least one parent born abroad) reached nearly four million. Regions of origin In 2018, the largest group of immigrants in the Netherlands came from other European countries, followed by migrants from Asian countries and the Americas. Over 1.4 million immigrants in the Netherlands were either born in another European country themselves or had a parent coming from here one. The Polish were especially well-represented, with nearly 24,000 immigrants in 2018. Attitudes towards immigration In a 2017 survey, respondents were asked how they feel about immigration from other EU countries. 70 percent stated to be fairly or very positive about this. By comparison, only five percent of the respondents answered to feel very negative about EU migration. Respondents were less positive about migration from non-EU countries, but the share of people feeling fairly or very positive about this still reached 45 percent.
