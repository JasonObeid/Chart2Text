 The consumer product revenue of The Walt Disney Company in 2018 amounted to 4.65 billion U.S. dollars. Retail and other sales brought in 1.59 billion U.S. dollars, whilst licensing, publishing, and games accounted for 3.06 billion dollars of the total figure. What does Disney’s consumer product segment include? The Walt Disney Company’s consumer products and interactive media segment licenses Disney’s characters, trade names, and visual/literary properties to developers, publishers, retailers and manufacturers all around the world. The segment also develops and publishes books and games, distributes merchandise and includes website management. Disney also has its media network business, which is the company’s most lucrative revenue source. This segment is comprised of Disney’s TV and radio networks and includes big names like ESPN, ABC, the Disney Channel, and Hulu. Whilst Disney’s media networks tend to pull in between 20 and 25 billion U.S. dollars in revenue each year, its studio entertainment business has also undergone relatively steady growth over the past decade. In 2018, Disney’s studio entertainment segment generated just under ten billion dollars in revenue, a serious improvement from 2012 and 2013 when the revenue failed to hit six billion in either year. The segment acquires and produces live-action and animated motion pictures, live stage plays, direct-to-video content, and musical recordings.
