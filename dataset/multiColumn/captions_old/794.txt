 This statistic depicts the global production of yttrium from 2010 to 2013, by country. In 2013, China's yttrium mine production amounted to approximately 7,000 metric tons of yttrium-oxide. Yttrium Yttrium belongs to the group of transition metals, as well as to the so called rare earth elements. The latter is because of its similarities to the group of lanthanides, with which it is often found together naturally. This chemical element got its name from a mine near Ytterby, Sweden, where it was found for the first time in 1787 by the chemist Carl A. Arrhenius. Like many other rare earth elements, yttrium is frequently used for metallurgical and magnetic purposes. Furthermore, yttrium oxides and sulfides, for example, find their way into screens and radars. The world’s largest yttrium producer is China, which also produces nearly 90 percent of total global rare earth production. In 2013, China mined almost 99 percent of all yttrium production worldwide. Other countries with smaller yttrium mine production figures include India, Brazil and Malaysia. China also holds the largest deposits of yttrium on Earth. As of 2013, these reserves were estimated to be some 220 thousand metric tons. The United States has yttrium reserves of an estimated 120 thousand metric tons, making it the holder of the second largest deposit worldwide. Australia, India, Malaysia, Brazil and Sri Lanka are other countries with substantial yttrium holdings.
