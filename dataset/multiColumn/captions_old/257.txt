 The death rate from firearm-related injuries in the United States reached 19.4 per 100,000 population among males in 2016. Females have a much smaller rate of firearm-related deaths than males, with the rate among males over five times that of females. The overall death rate from firearm-related injuries has risen in recent years after seeing a drop in the late 1990s. Homicides from firearms Homicides account for a large portion of firearm-related deaths. In 2017, there were almost 11,000 homicides by firearm in the United States. In fact, as of that time, homicides by firearm accounted for around 72.6 percent of all homicides in the U.S. Handguns are the most commonly used firearm for homicide. Gun ownership Firearms regulation, or gun control, remains a relevant and divisive issue in the U.S. However, the ownership of legal firearms is widespread. As of 2018, around 43 percent of households had at least one firearm, an increase from recent years. Unsurprisingly, just as men have a higher death rate from firearms, they also have a much higher firearm ownership rate.
