 The global nuclear energy market is expected to grow over the next years, with the nuclear generation segment reaching 300 billion U.S. dollars. In addition to the already operable nuclear reactors all over the world, there are also nuclear reactors currently under construction, most notably in China, Russia, and India. In these countries, there are also several reactors being planned and in various stages of approval, funding, or major commitments already in place. Nuclear debate Global nuclear power generation has risen steadily over the last decades, however, the risks and benefits of using nuclear energy has long been debated. In the light of climate change, advocates often point to a reliable and emission-free electricity as an alternative to fossil fuel sources. Using nuclear energy can be considered a clean energy source with an extremely high-energy density source, uranium. Advocates also state that it is the only viable energy option for energy dependence and to reach climate goals. On the other hand, skeptics point to nuclear accidents, such as the Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Three Mile Island disasters, as well as potential targets for global terrorism. Environmental and health risks may also be cited, including accidents and environmental damage from the uranium mining process. The uncertainty behind the current methods used to store radioactive nuclear waste is also of concern.
