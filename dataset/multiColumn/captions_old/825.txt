 U.S. tech companies are currently the most valuable brands in the world, covering the four top spots in 2019. Apple led the list with a brand value of around 234 billion U.S. dollars, followed by Google, Amazon and Microsoft. The highest-ranked non-tech company was Coca-Cola in fifth place, and the highest non-U.S. company was Samsung in sixth. ‘Brand value’ Brand value is determined by the source using a combination of financial information, the role the brand plays in determining consumer choice (independent of other factors such as price and convenience), and a qualitative assessment of the brand’s overall strength. If only financial data is taken into account then the same four companies are at the top, with Apple, Amazon, Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and Microsoft having the highest global market capitalizations. However, if only the qualitative factors regarding brand strength are considered the list looks very different, with Italian carmaker Ferrari being the strongest brand in 2019. ‘Brand value vs. profitability’ Brand value does not always translate into profitability. While Apple also happens to be the second most profitable company in the world, other companies with a strong brand such as Google and Amazon rank lower in terms of net income. This phenomenon does not only apply to tech companies – Coca-Cola also does not feature on the list of the most profitable companies worldwide. This is likely due to their franchised distribution structure, whereby manufacturing operations are handed by separate companies, each of which operates independently with an exclusive license to manufacture Coca Cola beverages in their territory.
