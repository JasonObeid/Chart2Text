 Deloitte reported total revenue figures of around 46.2 billion U.S. dollars in 2019, the most of the Big Four accounting firms. The company also led the rankings in the Americas, but it was PwC who came out on top in both the Asia Pacific and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) regions. Accounting around the world Deloitte generated around 24.2 billion U.S. dollars in North and South America in 2019, which was more than half of their overall revenue worldwide. A similar story was reported by PwC, with almost half of their aggregated worldwide revenue in 2019 being made in the regions of the Asia Pacific and EMEA. PwC experienced particularly strong growth in EMEA where aggregate revenues in the region in 2019 increased by nearly half a billion U.S. dollars on the previous year. Who are the Big Four? The four biggest accounting firms worldwide are Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Ernst and Young (EY), and Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler (KPMG). Known as the Big Four, the companies have a significant oligopoly in the accounting market: they collectively generated close to 155 billion U.S. dollars worldwide in 2019 and employed over one million people globally. Until 1989, the market had been dominated by eight accounting firms – also known as audit firms or professional services networks – but the number has since halved due to mergers and the collapse of major American accounting firm Arthur Andersen.
