 In 2018, Volkswagen shares closed at almost 140 euros: Volkswagen's preference shares were valued at just under 139 euros, while ordinary shares closed at a little over 139 euros. In 2018, Volkswagen’s shares were worth significantly less than five years earlier. Much of this drop in value is attributed to the company’s involvement in the 2015 diesel emissions scandal. Effects on stock price Shareholders of Volkswagen stock are experiencing continuous ups and downs. VW shares took a hit in 2015, when the manufacturer of light and commercial vehicles recorded an operating loss of more than four billion euros for the financial year. In September 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency issued a notice of violations to Volkswagen. The release of this paper led to a decline in value of Volkswagen's shares, and a lack of transparency from the board has cost VW further damage. Profits have recovered quickly and so did product sales, but the emissions scandal is still ongoing. Several firm representatives face legal action for intentionally withholding information from investors.
