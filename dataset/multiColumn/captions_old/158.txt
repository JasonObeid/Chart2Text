 The statistic shows the annual online commerce revenues of the Alibaba Group from 2010 to 2019. In the fiscal year ending March 31, 2019, the Chinese e-commerce corporation recorded a revenue of 247.6 billion yuan in Chinese online sales. This translates to approximately 35.8 billion U.S. dollars. As of 2016, the gross merchandise volume of China's e-commerce market amounted to around 4.7 trillion yuan and was forecasted to exceed ten trillion yuan by 2020. Some of the factors contributing to this growth are increased internet penetration and ever-growing spending power of the general population, but also the expansion of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group. The revenue of Alibaba Group reached 376.8 billion yuan (approximately 54.5 billion U.S. dollars) in 2019. Alibaba’s most prominent e-commerce websites are Taobao Marketplace, TMall and Alibaba.com, an online market platform called Alimama, a developer of platforms for cloud computing and data management called Alicloud, as well as a financial services provider called Ant Finacial Services Group, to only name a few of its ventures. Payment provider Alipay has been spun off in 2010 into an independent company. The company’s most profitable day in 2018 was Single’s Day, a popular Chinese festival functioning like the antithesis of Valentine’s Day. On November 11, Chinese singles throughout the country celebrate being single and proud, especially by treating themselves with presents. Around this date in 2018, over one billion orders were placed on Alibaba's Tmall and Taobao, amounting to almost 31 billion U.S. dollars in sales.
