 In 2018, Boeing's worldwide revenue amounted to about 101 billion U.S. dollars. Leading aircraft manufacturers and suppliers Aircraft manufacturing can be divided into a commercial and a defense segment. While military aircraft manufacturing is likely to see a decline in revenue in the near future, commercial aircraft production is forecast to further expand its market size. Growth is projected to be largely driven by orders from commercial airlines that are keen to meet increased passenger travel demand. The rising number of commercial airline passengers is closely intertwined with the growing affluence in emerging markets. Although Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has entered the market, there are essentially four major jet manufacturers - including Canada-based Bombardier and Brazil-based Embraer (Empresa Brasileira de Aeronáutica) - albeit, for many years, the commercial jet aviation market has been a de facto duopoly between the European aircraft maker Airbus and the US aircraft builder Boeing. These two companies share between them about 65 percent of the world airliner fleet. The defense segment is expected to face military budget reductions in mature markets that will only partially be offset by increased military spending in the Middle East, Russia and China. The global leading defense manufacturers include Boeing, Lockheed Martin, EADS/Airbus and Northrop Grumman. In the area of engines and parts manufacturing, there is great competition between a number of companies, often conglomerates that are active in a variety of industries. CFM International and General Electric and the UK’s Rolls Royce Group, a company that should not be confused with the wholly BMW-owned automobile marque, are among the largest suppliers of engines for aircraft.
