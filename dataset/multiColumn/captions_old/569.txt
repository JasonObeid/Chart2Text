 In 2019, the population of Belgium numbered around 11.4 million. Most of these inhabitants lived in the Dutch-speaking Flemish Region, which was home to nearly half of Belgium’s population. The Walloon Region, broadly in line with the French-speaking part of Belgium, numbered roughly 3.6 million inhabitants, and another 1.2 million lived in Brussels and the surrounding areas (which are bilingual). Population density by region Despite having the lowest number of inhabitants, the Brussels-Capital Region had the highest population density, at nearly 7,400 inhabitants per square kilometer in 2017. By comparison, this was less than 500 inhabitants in Flanders and just 214 in Wallonia. GDP per region Wallonia was not just the region with the lowest number of inhabitants per square kilometer, it also had the lowest GDP per capita. In 2016, the most recent available year, GDP per capita reached 27,220 euros in this region. In contrast, GDP per capita was nearly 2.5 times as high in Brussels, at nearly 64,000 euros per capita.
