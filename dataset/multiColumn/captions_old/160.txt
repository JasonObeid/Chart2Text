 The statistic depicts the brand value of the most valuable English football teams from 2011 to 2019. Manchester United had a brand value of 1.65 billion U.S. dollars in 2019. A brand is defined here as the trademark and associated intellectual property. Football clubs are made up of a mixture of fixed tangible assets (stadium, training ground) and disclosed intangible assets (purchased players) with brand value. To calculate brand values the Royalty Relief method was used. This approach assumes the company doesn't own their brand and must license it from a theoretical third party. The method determines how much it would cost to do this. The English Premier League, which is a private company wholly owned by its member clubs, is the highest organized level of professional football (soccer) in England. In the league, 20 clubs compete for the championship playing each other twice during the course of the season. The league works on a system of promotion and relegation in conjunction with the subordinate Football League. The best three teams of the Football League are promoted each year and the worst three of the Premier League are relegated.
