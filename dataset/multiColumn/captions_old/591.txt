 This statistic shows the half-year value of the statutory interest rate in the Netherlands from January 2013 to July 2019. Statutory interest rate is the interest due as a compensation for losses due to delays for an obligation to pay a sum of money. In other words, it is a rate a creditor can demand by law from a defaulting debtor. This is different then, for example, the long-term interest rate, or yield on ten-year government bonds, in the Netherlands or the interest rate for new mortgages. Statutory interest for commercial transactions applies to deliveries to companies and the government, whilst in the case of deliveries to consumers the statutory interest rate for non-commercial transactions applies. Statutory interest cannot be claimed if there is a different rate of interest in a contract. In the event of a default at a commercial transaction after 01/12/2002, a creditor could impose an interest of eight percent in January 2019. In the last years, the statutory interest rate for non-commercial transactions decreased from three percent in July 2012 to two percent in January 2017. In the same period, the interest rate for commercial transactions reached a value of approximately eight percent.
