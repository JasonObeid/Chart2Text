 Chile is the world’s largest iodine producer, with an estimated production volume of some 18,000 metric tons in 2019. The second largest global producer of iodine is Japan, which consistently produces around 9,000 metric tons annually. The total global production of iodine (excluding the United States) amounted to an estimated 28,000 metric tons in 2019. Iodine uses Iodine is an element with important nutritional uses, such as preventing iodine deficiency, in addition to its use as a catalyst in the production of acetic acid and polymers. Though it is perhaps most widely known as an additive in table salt, the largest share of iodine demand globally is attributed to its use in X-ray contrast media. Iodine reserves Inversely from production figures, Japan has the largest iodine reserves in the world, while Chile has the second largest reserves. Although the United States’ iodine production figures are not disclosed due to proprietary data, their reserve quantities are. As of 2019, the U.S.’s iodine reserves amounted to approximately 250,000 metric tons.
