 Even though Spain is continually losing its nationals, the inflow migration figures of the European country saw an increase over the last few years, ceasing the country’s ongoing downward trend in population in 2016. The population of Spain has been in decline for many years and was projected to decrease by nearly one million by 2023. A matter of balance The net migration rate of Spain changed its course mainly due to the great inflow of foreigners that move to reside in the Mediterranean country. Spain’s immigration flow slowed down after the 2008 financial crisis, albeit the number of foreigners that opted to change their residence saw a significant growth in the last years. In 2017, Moroccans ranked first as the foreign nationality that most relocated to Spain, closely followed by Colombians and Venezuelans. Spain does not have the highest number of immigrants in Europe In 2015, the European Union confronted a rising number of refugees arriving from the Middle East. Migration figures show that Germany accommodated approximately 14 million foreign-born citizens, ranking it as the country that most hosted immigrants in Europe in 2018. By comparison, Spain’s foreign population stood merely over six million, positioning the Western Mediterranean country sixth on the European list of foreign-born population.
