 The statistic depicts the brand value of the most valuable French football teams from 2011 to 2018. Paris Saint-Germain had a brand value of 913 million U.S. dollars in 2018. A brand is defined here as the trademark and associated intellectual property. Football clubs are made up of a mixture of fixed tangible assets (stadium, training ground) and disclosed intangible assets (purchased players) with brand value. To calculate brand values the Royalty Relief method was used. This approach assumes the company doesn't own their brand and must license it from a theoretical third party. The method determines how much it would cost to do this.
