The BRIC countries have been experiencing an economical boom over the past several years and therefore have seen significant gains in the production of goods and services. Additionally, each of the four countries had one of the top 10 largest gross domestic products in 2014, producing more than developed countries such as Canada and Australia. Unemployment rates have also been correspondingly low in these countries, with the exception of India. China, Russia and Brazil maintained an unemployment rate of roughly 6 percent or less in 2013, indicating their economies are still demanding workers in order to produce. Despite China having the largest population in the world, work is constantly in demand due to cheap labor and lower costs for many manufacturing companies globally. However, there have often been complaints of poor working conditions in Chinese factories, regularly leading to complaints and much criticism from the general public. As a result, several companies are considering decreasing production of their goods in these factories.
