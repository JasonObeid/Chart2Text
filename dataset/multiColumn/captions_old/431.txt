Accidents Recreational boating is a popular leisure activity in the United States with participants using boats for (sports) activities such as fishing and water skiing and/or travel. Unfortunately, participating in these activities can result in accidents and damages - in 2017, the total damages caused by boating accidents in the U.S. amounted to around 46 million U.S. dollars. Causes Offering little protection space, it is not surprising that the vessel type involved in the majority of boating accidents is the open motorboat – with over two and a half thousand of these boats involved in accidents in 2017. In that year a survey found that the primary contributing factor of recreational boating accidents was inattention by the operator, accounting for over six hundred accidents in the U.S. in 2017.
