 Over 35,000 Cadillac Escalades were sold in the United States in 2019, making it the best-selling model of large luxury cars in the U.S. that year. Luxury cars are typically characterized by the importance placed on passenger comfort and quality of equipment. Here, “large” means car types that are in the category of, or larger than, a full-sized sedan (saloon car in the UK). The only fully-electric model on the list is the Tesla Model S, which saw 2019 figures fail to reach even half of its extremely successful 2018 sales.
