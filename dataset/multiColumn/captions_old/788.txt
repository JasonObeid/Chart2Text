 This statistic shows the most popular movie genres among adults in the United States as of December 2018, sorted by age group. The findings reveal that favorability of the horror genre reduced with age, with 68 percent of 18 to 29 year olds saying that they found horror movies very or somewhat favorable, compared to just 30 percent of adults aged 65 or above. Conversely, the drama genre was more popular among older generations. During the survey it was also revealed that a respondent's gender affected attitudes towards certain movie genres, and the results even reinforced popular stereotypes. For example, favorability of musicals and romantic films was lower among men, and 17 percent more female respondents had a very or somewhat favorable impression of romantic comedies than their male counterparts. Interesting comparisons were also drawn when looking at results based on ethnicity, which can be found here.
