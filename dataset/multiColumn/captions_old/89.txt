As of November 2018, the platform, which is headquartered in Stockholm and London, had 87 million paying users and in 2018 had approximately 207 million monthly active listeners. Spotify’s appeal does not only lie in its music streaming and online radio capabilities but the platform’s strong social components such as users being able to add and message friends, as well as being able to create and share music playlists as well as recommend tracks to connected users. Spotify also allows users to login with their Facebook accounts and to cross-post their listening habits to the social network. In 2015, the company’s revenue surpassed 1 billion euros for the first time but not without a cost – that year, Spotify’s net loss amounted to 162 million euros.

With digital streaming music revenue in the United States surpassing 5.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2017, Spotify is strongly positioned to take advantage of the expanding North American streaming market.
