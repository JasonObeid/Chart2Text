 Between the 1950s and today, the average age to marry in the Netherlands increased significantly for both genders. Whereas in 1950, men were on average 30 years old when they married and women were nearly 27 years old, in 2018 this was 38.2 and 35.2 years respectively. This raise in the average age at marriage however meant a decrease in the number of marriages per person, which decreased by over 0.10 in the last decade alone. The average Dutch male married 0.57 times in 2018, whereas the average female married 0.55 times. Number of marriages In 2018, roughly 64,300 marriages took place. The majority of these marriages were closed between a man and a woman, but since the same-sex marriage was legalized in the Netherlands in 2001, each year also between 1,200 and 1,500 same-sex couples tie the knot. In the last decade, the number of marriages peaked in 2008, when over 75,400 marriages took place. Living happily ever after In 2017, nearly 60,000 couples celebrated 12.5 years of marital bliss, and a further 58,700 couples had been married for 25 years. And of course, with time the number of special wedding anniversaries decreases, as divorce or death dissolves many a marriage. Still, that year 345 couples celebrated 70 years of wedded life together.
