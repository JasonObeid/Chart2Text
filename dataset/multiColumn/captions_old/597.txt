 Deloitte employed around 312,000 people worldwide in 2019, with approximately 140,000 of those employees based in the Americas. The accounting firm continues to increase its global workforce and has also reported steady revenue growth across all regions. Deloitte’s employee experience Next to the Americas region, Deloitte employed approximately 102,000 members of staff in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) in 2019, which is around one third of their total number of employees worldwide. Of all the personnel worldwide in 2019, more than 250,000 were professional staff members working, for example, as qualified auditors, tax advisors, or lawyers. Further analysis of Deloitte’s employee figures in 2019 shows that 137,000 staff members were women, which is 44 percent of their total workforce. Is the accounting industry at risk? Deloitte is one of the Big Four accounting firms – also known as audit firms or professional services networks. The dominance of this group of four is highlighted by the fact that in 2018, the joint revenue of the firms ranked from fifth to ninth was as large as the smallest of the Big Four. There is growing concern that if one of the Big Four collapses – as happened to American firm Arthur Andersen in 2002 – the remaining three might not have the resources to cope and could struggle to absorb all of the work, leaving all the clients of the failed firm facing the prospect of financial ruin.
