 This statistic displays the value of the dietary supplements market in Europe in 2015 and 2020, by country. Italy is the leading country in terms of the dietary supplements market with a value of 1.4 billion euros in 2015, which is expected to increase to 1.6 billion euros by 2020. Dietary supplements are a lucrative market, with increases in sales values forecasted across Europe. Similarly, the vitamin and dietary supplements industry as a whole is predicted to increase in retail value. Dietary supplements are often plant-based and appeal to consumer desire for natural products, particularly when it comes to functional medicinal properties. The plant-food supplements industry is consequently thriving alongside increased consumer awareness of health-related behavior.
