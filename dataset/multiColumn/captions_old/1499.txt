 This statistic presents the results of a survey asking school students if they used full-size tablets at least a few times a week for their school work. The results are differentiated by the subjects that they would use a tablet device for and the level of school they were in. Through the survey, it was found that 42 percent of US elementary school students used a full-sized tablet for their science school work at least a few times per week.
