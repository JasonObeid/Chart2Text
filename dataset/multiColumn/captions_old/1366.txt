 This statistic presents the number of ATMs (automated teller machines) for cash withdrawal in selected countries of Western Europe as of December 2017 and December 2018. Automated teller machines are banking outlets, which allow basic financial transactions, such as checking of the account balance or withdrawing cash, to be carried out without an assistance of the branch representative. Debit or credit card is all that is needed to provide fund access, and security of the operation is typically ensured by a PIN (personal identification number) code. More complex ATM units also allow for depositing money or establishing of credit lines. As of December 2018, more than 63 thousand ATMs were installed and operational in the United Kingdom. Between December 2017 and December 2018 almost 6.5 thousand ATMs in the UK closed. Despite the fact, that the population of Germany surpassed the population of the UK by approximately 17 million in 2015, the number of ATMs operational in that country was lower by over approximately 5.4 thousand, as of December 2018.
