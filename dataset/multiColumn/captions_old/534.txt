 This statistic shows the market share of grocery store brands in France for the years 2008, 2013 and a forecast for 2018. The leading three supermarkets based on market share in 2013 were "Systeme A" (Auchan and System U partnership), Carrefour and Leclerc. Leclerc's share of the market is forecast to increase again in 2018, to 19.3 percent. The grocery retail landscape in France has been dominated by the Leclerc Group and Carrefour group, who have been fighting neck in neck for the lead position. Up until January 2017, Carrefour had the largest share of the grocery retail market, at which point Leclerc overtook it to become the largest supermarket in France. Carrefour, however, is also the most valuable French food brand. France has one of the largest markets for online grocery shopping worldwide due to the early introduction of drive-through collection services, second only to the United Kingdom within Europe. The share of individuals who have purchased food or groceries online is thus increasing year on year.
