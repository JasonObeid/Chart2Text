 The statistic shows a comparison of Apple Inc.'s, Google Inc.'s / Alphabet Inc.'s, and Microsoft Corp.'s revenues during the fiscal years from 2008 to 2018. In the fiscal year 2018, hardware-focused Apple's 265.6 billion US dollar revenue was almost double the amount of online-based Google's 136.2 billion U.S. dollars, with Microsoft generating 110.36 billion US dollars that same year. Whereas all of these companies have different market strengths, there are also overlaps and thus, competition. Apple and Google are direct competitors in the mobile phone market with their iOS and Android systems - in 2017, Android accounted for 85.9 percent compared to Apple's 14 percent (and Microsoft's miniscule percent) of smartphone shipments. However, with over 51 billion U.S. dollars in iPhone revenues during the most recent fiscal quarter, Apple sure is no slouch when it comes to monetizing its products.
