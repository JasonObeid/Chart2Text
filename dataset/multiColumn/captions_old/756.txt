The Canadian pork market The volume of pork produced in Canada has steadily increased over the past four years, reaching around 2.12 million metric tons in 2018. More than half of this volume was exported in the same year . Unsurprisingly, the United States was Canada’s biggest pork trading partner in 2017, receiving approximately 424,790 metric tons, followed by Japan and China in second and third places. Pork consumption Despite increasing pork production in Canada, consumption is declining. In 2019, it was forecast that per capita consumption would reach around 27.3 kilograms, a decrease of almost seven kilograms since the turn of the century.
