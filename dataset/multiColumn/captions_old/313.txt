 The largest carbon dioxide (CO2) emitter in the world is Asia Pacific, where there was 16.27 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted in 2018. China, alone, produced about 27 percent of the global territorial fossil fuel CO2 emissions. It is likely that top emitting countries will continue releasing more carbon dioxide every year. Yet, the level of emissions in high income countries have stabilized in comparison to the large emissions growth in low- and middle-income regions. However, based on per capita emissions, countries like the United States, Australia, and Canada are the largest CO2 emitters in the world. Carbon dioxide emissions Historically, global carbon dioxide emissions have risen exponentially since the pre-Industrial Revolution period. Carbon dioxide emissions are largely released through the combustion of fossil fuels have increased over the last decades. Under current energy trends, emissions are spread fairly evenly across oil, coal, and natural gas sources. This disruption of the global carbon cycle has a range of ecological, physical, and health impacts such as altered crop growth, extreme weather patterns, and sea-level rise.
