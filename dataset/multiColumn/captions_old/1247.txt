 The statistic shows the most favorable James Bond actors according to adults in the United States as of November 2018. The findings reveal that Sean Connery was the favorite among survey respondents, with 61 percent stating that they had a very favorable impression of the actor's interpretation of James Bond. A total of 51 percent said the same about Pierce Brosnan. When asked about George Lazenby, the majority of respondents (46 percent) said that they did not know or had no opinion, perhaps largely due to Lazenby having only featured in one film within the franchise.
