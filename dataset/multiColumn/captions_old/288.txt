 U.S. sales of most classes of medium and heavy trucks have been increasing year-on-year since 2009, with the notable exception of class 8 heavy trucks, which have fallen sharply in recent years; in 2017 a total of 192,000 class 8 trucks were sold in the U.S., compared to the 249,000 sold in 2015. In 2018, class 8 trucks sales recovered, with 251,000 units sold. Commercial vehicle classifications Commercial motor vehicles in the United States are divided into eight different classes based on weight. Light duty trucks are included in classes 1 and 2, medium duty trucks in classes 3 to 6, and heavy trucks in classes 7 and 8. The weight range for each class is not consistent – for example class 3 includes trucks between 10,001 and 14,000 pounds, class 5 is between 16,001 and 19,500 pounds, and class 7 is between 26,001 and 33,000 pounds. Sales for all truck classes – including Class 8 – are expected to increase over the short term. Global commercial vehicle market Over the last decade Chinese demand for commercial vehicles has overtaken that of the United States. Based on projections, sales of trucks over 15 tons (class 8) are three to four times higher in China than in the United States, while sales of trucks between 6 and 15 tons (roughly classes 4 to 7) are around 50 percent higher. However, commercial vehicle production in the U.S. is higher than in China, with the 8.52 million trucks produced in the U.S. in 2018 being around twice the Chinese production numbers of that year. When considering only heavy trucks though, production is much higher in the Asia-Pacific region than in North America. This is likely due to multiple major vehicle-producing countries, such as Japan, China, Thailand and India, being located in the region.
