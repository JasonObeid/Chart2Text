 This statistic presents the most important attributes of facial skin care products to male and female consumers in the United Kingdom, according to a survey conducted in March 2013. Skin moisturising and hydrating attributes were considered the most important attributes for both genders, with 73 percent of women stating this as important. The anti-ageing moisturiser market takes up the largest proportion of the facial skin care market with a share of 41.6 percent in 2013. Over The Counter skin treatments, or OTC's have seen a significant decline in sales value since 2009, with a decline of nearly 210 million British pounds. This could be due to harder regulation in European countries, or by the fact that consumers are more interested in organic and natural skin products. A total of 54 percent of people claimed that they want no chemical ingredients in their personal care products and 30 percent stated that they want non animal tested products.
