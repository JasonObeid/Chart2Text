 For the FY 2020, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requested a total of 1.92 billion U.S. dollars for its entire cyber security budget, making it the second-largest budget among the government agencies. The Department of Defense (DoD) had the biggest proposed cyber security budget with a request of 9.6 billion U.S. dollars. Overall cyber security spending in the United States is projected to increase by approximately 5 percent in FY 2020. Total proposed agency cyber security funding in 2020 is 17.44 billion U.S. dollars. U.S. government and cyber security spending The White House released a National Cyber Strategy in September 2018. The overall increase in cyber security spending strongly correlates with the White House’s plan to increase military spending. However, the DoD is the only department with such a significant increase in cyber security spending; most civilian agencies are preparing for budget cuts. Overall, cyber security spending of the U.S. government on CFO Act and non-CFO Act agencies is projected to increase from 14.98 billion U.S. dollars in FY 2018 to 17.44 billion U.S. dollars in FY 2020. U.S. government and cyber crime The U.S. government is a prominent target for cyber crime. In 2017, U.S. government agencies reported 35,277 cyber incidents, an approximately 14 percent increase from the previous year. The government and military accounted for eight percent of data breaches in the United States in 2018, up from 4.7 percent in the previous year. Common types of cyber attacks directed at the U.S. government are e-mail or phishing attacks, improper usage, and loss or theft of equipment.
