 Figures covering the frequency of mobile phone use show a relatively even split among genders in the United Kingdom (UK) during 2019. Males were slightly more likely to use their mobile phones to make calls several times a day, while less than one percent of female respondents reported never using a mobile phone to make calls. Mobile call volume increasing The volume of calls made using mobile phones has increased over the past several years. In 2009 users of mobile phones placed 120.57 billion minutes worth of calls in the UK. By 2017, this figure had reached 148.64 billion minutes. Mobile phone users in the UK made 36.6 billion minutes of calls during the fourth quarter of 2017. Average revenue decreasing Despite increasing call volumes, the average revenue per user (ARPU) of the mobile network decreased in recent years. Vodafone UK contract mobile customers, for example, generated a monthly ARPU of 26.7 British pounds in the fourth quarter of 2014/15. By the first quarter of 2018/19, that figure fell to 22.7 British pounds.
