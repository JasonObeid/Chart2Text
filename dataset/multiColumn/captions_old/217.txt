 This statistic shows the population of the Netherlands from 2010 to 2018, by religion. It shows that the percentage of the people that does not identify with any religion continued to grow between 2010 and 2018, from 45 to 53 percent of the people. The largest group in 2018 was the Roman Catholic group with 22 percent of the Dutch people identifying as Roman Catholic. That is particularly interesting, as the dominating church in the Netherlands since the Reformation had been the Protestant church. According to the source, in 2018 15 percent of the Dutch population considered themselves a member of the three main protestant churches, the Dutch Reformed Church, the Protestant Church in the Netherlands and the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. Although some people in the Netherlands fear the increase in the number of Muslims, this statistic actually shows that the share of Muslims living in the Netherlands remained stable between 2010 and 2018, with Muslims making up five percent of the Dutch population.
