 This statistic shows the share of grocery retail sales in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2014 with a forecast for 2019, by retail channel. Superstore and hypermarket share of sales is predicted to fall from 42.2 percent to 34.9 percent in 2019, with share expected to increase through discounter, convenience and online channels. Grocery shopping in the United Kingdom (UK) is currently dominated by the 'big four' supermarkets, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons, although the market share of grocery stores has been increasingly volatile. With the introduction of the discounters, as well as the increasing prevalence of online shopping, fewer consumers are conducting their main shops in supermarkets, instead opting for more convenience-based formats. Thus online shopping is expected to experience the largest increase in value along with discounters, while other channels will remain comparatively stagnant.
