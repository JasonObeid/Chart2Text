 Is porn consumed only by men? It seems that this stereotype is still partly true in 2019. In Europe, men are the main visitors of the porn website Pornhub. This can indicate that pornographic viewing remains an activity mostly done by men. However, Sweden and Poland female visitors of Pornhub accounted for 35 percent of all visitors from their countries. Furthermore, approximatively a quarter of visitors were women in other European countries. In other words, women also appear to consume porn. A gender-gap in frequency of porn consumption In 2014, French men were more frequently visiting pornographic sites than women. A quarter of responding men visited such websites at least once a week in France, whereas only three percent of women declared that they visited one in a week. For this reason, it could be discussed that even though women do consume porn, in terms of frequency men are the main consumers. Porn consumption parallels the evolution of technology Long gone is the reign of magazines, videotapes and even DVDs. Nowadays, pornographic websites, like Pornhub, are leading the industry. With technology evolving, more and more people are visiting these websites on their mobile phones. In the Netherlands, such mobile phone use grew from 51 percent in 2015 to 62 percent in 2018. Similar findings were discovered in France . In spite of this, pornography remains a sensitive topic, at least in the U.S., where over half of Americans stated that porn was morally wrong.
