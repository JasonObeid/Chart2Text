 This statistic shows the age structure in Syria from 2008 to 2018. In 2018, about 31.42 percent of Syria's total population were aged 0 to 14 years. The shrinking population of Syria In the past, Syria’s population has been one of the fastest growing populations around the world. While the fertility rate is much lower now than it has been, in 2013, World Bank figures show a fertility rate of 3 children per woman. This rate is still relatively high, but the country’s historically expanding population has left the country with a large cohort of young people: Almost 40 percent of the Syrian population is under 14 years of age, with close to 60 percent of the population aged 15 to 64. This leaves around a meager 4 percent of Syrians who are over 65 years old. At present, the median age of the population is estimated to be around 23 years, which means half the population is under 23, leaving large numbers of young people at the mercy of the war that has plagued the country. As of October 2015, 12,517 children were reportedly killed in the fighting, with the number of unreported cases being presumably much higher than this. This dire situation has caused many people to flee the country and it is no surprise that the majority of them are young. Despite a high fertility rate, this mass emigration has significantly stalled population growth in the country, a trend which is expected to continue especially as an overwhelming majority of Syrians – 46 percent - stated they would leave the country if given the opportunity.
