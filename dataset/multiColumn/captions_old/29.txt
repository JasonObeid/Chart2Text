 This statistic illustrates the market share of grocers in Great Britain (GB) monthly from January 2015 to January 2020. Tesco and Sainsbury's had the largest share over the period under consideration, holding 43.1 percent of the market together as of January 2020. In March of 2019 Asda's share surpassed Sainsbury's which could recover the second position in the following month. Prior to the popularity of the discounters, the grocery retail market was dominated by the 'big four' supermarkets: Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons. On the back of the post-Brexit uncertainty and growing inflation, however, consumer behavior has shifted in favor of cheaper alternatives such as Aldi and Lidl.The resulting 'price wars' have led to supermarkets lowering their prices. Crucially, this has caused increased volatility in the grocery retail market and, as of January 2017, Aldi overtook the Co-operative to become the fifth largest supermarket in the United Kingdom. After a period of intense competition Lidl overtook Waitrose and is now poised to likely overtake the Cooperative in the coming year.
