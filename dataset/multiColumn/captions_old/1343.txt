 Monthly sales of grocery stores in Canada reached approximately 8.09 billion Canadian dollars in November 2019. This figure has gradually increased over the given survey period – in 2015 the average monthly sales value was 7.27 billion dollars. Canadians prefer shopping in-store As of December 2018, there were over 15,600 grocery stores located across Canada, signaling an ongoing demand for brick-and-mortar grocery stores, despite the rise of e-commerce in the Canadian retail sector. According to a recent survey, over 91 percent of surveyed Canadians stated that they spend more on groceries bought in-store than online. Some of the leading reasons preventing shoppers from buying groceries online in Canada include lack of interest, shipping costs and the risk of perishables going off.
