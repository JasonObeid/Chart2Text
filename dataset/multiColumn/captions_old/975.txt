 The statistic shows the size of various segments of the virtual private network (VPN) market worldwide in 2014 with a forecast to 2019. In 2019, the size of the multiprotocol label switching VPN market is expected to grow from 26 billion U.S. dollars to 32 billion U.S. dollars worldwide. Overall, the global VPN market is valued at 45 billion U.S. dollars in 2014 and forecast for 70 billion U.S. dollars in 2019. Virtual private networks are designed to extend a network securely from a private location, such as a business or home, across a public network, as if the network were directly linked. VPNs are popular among consumers for obfuscating their real location, whether to access geo-blocked services or bypass censorship or other restrictions. Among enterprises, VPNs are often set up to allow employees to access corporate intranets while travelling or working from home.
