 A house in Rotterdam had a rent of approximately 16 euros per square meter in the third quarter of 2019. This was slightly below the national average of approximately 16.62 euros per square meters. Amsterdam and Utrecht, however, were more expensive. In recent years, the housing market has continued to rise in the Netherlands due to low mortgage rates, a recovering economy and a high level of consumer confidence. For example, the number of houses sold reached a value of approximately 242,000 in 2017 and the average selling price of houses was higher than in 2013, when prices reached a low point.
