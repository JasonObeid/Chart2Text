 This statistic compares the gross domestic product (GDP) in Catalonia and the whole of Spain between 2003 and 2017. GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year. It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country. Both Catalonia and Spain as a whole experienced a decrease in GDP between 2008 and 2013. However, in the last year the GDP of Catalonia had risen to its highest point at 234.7 billion euros, with the GDP of the whole of Spain amounting to 1.16 trillion euros. The development of GDP in Spain was thus closely linked to the average change of GDP in the Eurozone, with GDP of Spain having risen by 7.4 percent since 2009. By comparison, GDP of Catalonia had experienced a growth of 7.6 percent during that time. GDP of Catalonia made up roughly one fifth of Spain's GDP as a whole, its share fluctuating only marginally in the last ten years, with 19.3 percent being the lowest in 2009.
