 This statistic shows the monthly approval rating of the United Kingdom government from the end of January 2015 to the end of July 2015. Participants were asked if they approve or disapprove of the government’s record to date. During the period, approval ratings increased slightly from 32 percent in January to 38 percent in July, with the previous months of May and June marking the peak in approval ratings at 40 percent. A survey on the approval rating of the government under Theresa May showed that as of November 2016 46 percent of respondents were pleased with her work as Prime Minister, an increase of 8 percent compared with results this survey found on approval of the government under David Cameron until July 2015. These findings are reflected in a different survey regarding public opinion on the governance development post Brexit, which shows that 73 percent of respondents who voted leave believed that future laws passed by Parliament and the way the UK was governed would be better after the UK left the European Union. By comparison, 39 percent of respondents who voted Remain were of the opinion that governance of the UK would either worsen or stay the same, respectively.
