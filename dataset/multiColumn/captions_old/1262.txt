Vauxhall is the leading commercial vehicle producer based in the United Kingdom. In 2018, the Opel owned British car company manufactured 62,607 such vehicles in their Luton based plant. This was an increase of nearly five percent compared to the previous year. Since selling their first cars, Vauxhall established itself as a mainstay of the British automobile industry. Today it is the country’s oldest car brand still in production. Commercial vehicle sales in decline The sale of commercial vehicles in the United Kingdom declined in 2017. Although still topping 400,000 units, figures were lower than during the peaks recorded in 2015 and 2016. Registration figures echoed this development, with numbers for 2017 and 2018 noticeably lower than in the two years prior. Production in the EU In the European Union, production of commercial vehicles grew consecutively between 2012 and 2017. However, figures were still lower than those seen before the recession. The greatest share of such vehicles made were light units with a weight up to 3.5 metric tons.
