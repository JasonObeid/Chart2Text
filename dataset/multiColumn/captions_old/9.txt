 Despite being released in the fall of 2015, Marshmallow 6.0 remains the most widely used version of Android’s operating system on smartphone devices in 2019. Developers Google previously named its Android versions after items of confectionery, but in a break from tradition the latest release in September 2019 is simply called Android 10. Why are older Android versions still being used? It is considered good practice to install the latest version of software on to your smartphone for security reasons, but Android updates vary by device, manufacturer, and mobile carrier. It is also true that older devices cannot always run newer Android versions. Around 60 percent of Android devices are running a mobile operating system that is over two years old. In comparison, 88 percent of iPhone devices are running on the latest version of iOS. Unlocking the code to Android’s success Android is the mobile operating systems’ market leader worldwide. Since its initial unveiling in 2007, the platform has pursued a commitment to openness – its source code is freely available which allows smartphone manufacturers to install the software without having to pay a license. This reduction in costs allows vendors to make their devices cheaper than the competition. The average selling price of an Android smartphone worldwide was around 200 U.S. dollars in 2018 – more than 400 U.S. dollars cheaper than an iPhone.
