 Instagram usage among ages 40 to 64 years old in the Netherlands grew almost threefold in four years, with 20 percent of respondents using the platform in 2018. Instagram usage was increasing among all age groups, but it was especially popular among the Dutch population younger than 40 years old. At the end of 2019, nearly 6.2 million people, roughly one third of the entire population, used the photo-sharing app in the Netherlands. WhatsApp and Facebook, however, remained the two most popular online social platforms in the country, both having more than ten million users. Where is the 2019 data regarding Instagram users in the Netherlands? This ranking comes from an annual survey held in the Netherlands regarding social media use. In 2019, the source stopped asking about the age groups. However, 2019 data regarding Instagram use in the Netherlands, by both age as well as gender, is available. According to this new information, most users of the sharing app could be found in the age group of 25- to 34-year-olds. Additionally, there were more women who used Instagram than men. How about social media usage in the Netherlands, in general? In 2019, roughly 65 percent of the Dutch population claimed to be active social media users. Especially WhatsApp is a popular application in the Netherlands, since personal communication is the main purpose of social media for most Dutch consumers (ID 632658). Entertainment, news, following favorite brands or celebrities were less common arguments for people to use social media than being able to communicate with friends and family.
