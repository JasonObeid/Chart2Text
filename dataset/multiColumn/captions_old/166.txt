Wheat Wheat is one the most widely produced grains in the world, leading the grain market along with corn and rice in production and sales. Wheat is an important trade commodity due to its durability, longevity and its use as flour. The importing and exporting of wheat and wheat products is a complex worldwide business. As one of the leading wheat importers worldwide, Egypt exercises significant power over the import/export market.

The American Great Plains, comprised of Midwestern states such as Oklahoma, Kansas, and the Dakotas, among others, is known as America’s “Breadbasket” or “Grain Belt” due to the high production of grain crops in this region.
