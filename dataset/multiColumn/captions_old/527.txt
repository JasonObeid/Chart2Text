 Among the many digital marketing channels to choose from, SEO, content marketing and e-mail marketing together with automation commanded the largest share of marketers claiming that they generated the highest return on investment. Roughly a third of surveyed industry professionals believed that these three tactics were highly beneficial. Consequently, more than half of global marketers declared an increase in their budgets on all three channels in the same period. How effective is e-mail marketing? Global marketers estimated that e-mail generated a media ROI of 124 percent in 2017, by far the highest among other channels considered in the assessment. Further insight into the effectiveness of selected marketing channels indicates that e-mail is a clear winner when it comes to driving conversions later in the funnel, with no strong contenders demonstrating a similar level of success. E-mail marketing is also considered the best way to generate early engagement, and e-mail to first party lists is considered one of the most effective ways of cultivating high-quality leads.
