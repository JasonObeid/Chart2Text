 In 2018, the rate of unemployment in Belgium was six percent – the lowest it had been in a decade. There were real regional differences within the country though. The Flemish region did particularly well economically, with an unemployment rate of 3.5 percent in 2018. By comparison: unemployment was more than twice as high in the Walloon Region, and nearly four times as high in the Brussels-Capital Region. Number of unemployed per region Although Flanders had the lowest unemployment rate of all three regions, the actual number of unemployed people here was highest, at over 126,000 in 2018. The Brussels-Capital Region, which had the highest unemployment rate, counted only 70,347 unemployed that year. This is mainly a result of a demographic imbalance: the Flemish region has nearly twice as many inhabitants as the Walloon Region, and over five times as many as the Brussels-Capital Region. Unemployment forecasts According to a recent KBC forecast, the unemployment rate in Belgium was expected to decrease even further in 2019, to just under six percent. The Federal Plan Agency predicted a similar trend, with the number of unemployed people in Belgium falling from nearly 560,000 in 2017 to just under 390,000 in 2023.
