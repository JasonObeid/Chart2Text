 Buying and selling items online has become rather common over the last decade, as the latest studies can confirm. Spain is no exception to this trend, with its population gradually getting more comfortable with paying for products online. According to the latest figures, nearly half of the Spaniards preferred to pay for their online purchases through online payment systems such as PayPal, whereas slightly over 40 percent were more inclined to use their debit or credit card as their payment method of choice. In contrast, only five percent of the population paid with cash upon delivery. e-Commerce in Spain and its most successful sectors Electronic commerce has begun to see growth over the past decade, with its sales volume reaching figures of approximately 31.35 billion euros in 2017, differing greatly from the volume registered in 2007, which amounted to a mere 5.9 billion euros.
