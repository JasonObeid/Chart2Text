 This statistic compares the pass rates for men and women in driving theory tests in the United Kingdom (UK) between 2007/08 and 2018/19. Women consistently performed better than men at the theory tests by around six percent. Although the pass rates have been falling, the most recent drop can possibly be attributed, in part, to new, previously unpublished questions being used in the new tests. In the most recent fiscal years, 45.7 percent of men who took the theory drivers test passed, while 49.2 percent of women who took the test passed.
