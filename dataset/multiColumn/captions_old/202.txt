Global sponsorship spending - additional information Global sponsorship is a huge market and is still growing at a steady rate. This can be seen by the total revenue from sports sponsorship in North America since 2006. The sports sector is expected to continue to dominate the North American sponsorship market in 2018 with projected spend of 17.61 billion U.S. dollars. Sponsorship continues to be concentrated on more prestigious and profitable companies while the increases in funding directed at smaller rightsholders are estimated to stay below two percent in most cases. This is because sponsors look to create partnerships with well-established properties that can create incremental value for both parties through efforts such as developing content and creating new products. Yet corporate interest in other marketing alternatives, such as digital media, means that the rate of increase in sponsorship spending has slowed. Investment from North American companies is projected to rise by just over one billion U.S. dollars from 2017 to 2018.
