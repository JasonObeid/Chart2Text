 This statistic depicts the share of the soft drink market in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2015 to 2018, by category. In 2018, the largest share was held by carbonated drinks, accounting for 34.1 percent of the soft drink market, followed by juice drinks (23.6 percent). The market share of soft drink types in the United Kingdom is predominantly made up of carbonates, with the value of the market experiencing year on year increases. Levels of consumption, on the other hand, are decreasing and, with the incoming sugar tax levy due to be introduced in the Spring of 2018, the future of soft drink consumption remains uncertain. Average retail prices have previously already risen, with consumption seemingly suffering as a result.
