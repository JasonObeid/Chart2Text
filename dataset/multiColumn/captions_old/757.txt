 In all age groups until 34 years old, there were more men than women in Russia as of January 1, 2019. After that age, females outnumbered the male population in each category. The most represented age group of the country’s population was from 30 to 34 years old, with approximately 6.33 million women and 6.39 million men. Male-to-female ratio The number of men in Russia was historically lower than the number of women, which was a result of population losses during World War I and World War II. In 1950, in the age category from 25 to 29 years, 68 men were recorded per 100 women in the Soviet Union. In today’s Russia, the male-to-female ratio significantly increased, reaching 81 men per 100 women in 2019. Highest life expectancy gender gap The World Health Organization estimated the average life expectancy of women across the world at over four years longer than men. In Russia, this gap between genders exceeded 10 years. According to the study “Burden of disease in Russia, 1980-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016,” Russia had the highest gender difference in life expectancy worldwide.
