 In 2017, Liander was the operating manager (DSO or distribution system operator) with the highest market share in the Dutch electricity market. The Netherlands has a single electricity market, where taxes are imposed on a national basis. The country’s distribution network, however, operates on different regional levels. Liander, for example, operates in the Amsterdam area wheras Stedin is active in cities as Rotterdam and Utrecht and most of the South Holland and Utrecht provinces. Enexis operates in five of the 12 Dutch provinces: Groningen, Drenthe, Overijssel, Noord-Brabant (except for the city of Eindhoven) and Limburg. Together, these three DSOs serve the majority of inhabitants in the Netherlands. What about energy companies in the Netherlands? With Liander being the biggest electricity system operator, who is the biggest energy supplier in the Netherlands? As of 2018, it was estimated that Essent/energiedirect.nl had the most clients of all private energy companies active in the country. Market data for energy suppliers in the Netherlands is something domestic sources struggle to collect. In 2004, the Dutch government liberalized the supply of electricity and natural gas, allowing more energy suppliers to enter the market. As these companies don't have to openly share their data, the exact market shares are difficult to determine. This is different than in for example Belgium and Luxembourg, where companies have to share their data with the local authorities. Electricity prices are going both up and down In the first half of 2018, the average electricity price for Dutch households was 17.06 euro cents per kWh. This was the highest value reached since 2016. The opposite development could be seen for industrial companies as industrial prices for electricity continued their decrease.
