 This statistic contains circulation numbers for Newsday. In the six month period ending March 31, 2013, the average weekday circulation was 377,744 copies. Average paid circulation of Newsday Newsday is an American daily newspaper that was founded in 1940 and is based in Melville, New York. Its news division focuses on Nassau and Suffolk counties with additional emphases on parts of Long Island, Queens, as well as Rockland and Westchester counties. It was founded by the daughter of the New York Daily News Founder, Alicia Peterson, who received funding from her husband at the time, Harry Guggenheim. It is now a subsidiary of Cablevision which purchased the paper for $650 million in 2008. It has won 19 Pulitzer Prizes over the course of its history and has a reputable history despite its tabloid style formatting. Even with a solid content base, though, the paper has not been an exception to the industry trend of reduced circulation and readership numbers. Fortunately, it has been able to establish a relatively healthy internet presence with the fourth highest circulation of digital newspaper editions, falling behind only the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and New York Daily News. This online presence will continue to be make-or-break as print newspaper readership numbers continue their steady and expected declines.One area where Newsday has shown positive trends is with its Sunday edition. While it has experienced on-going declines in circulation and readership numbers, by 2012 the number of readers had leveled out and actually grew slightly over the fall of 2011. Though this is unlikely to begin a new trend, it does provide some hope that in the right publishing markets with adept marketing and content focus, some newspapers may be here to stay.
