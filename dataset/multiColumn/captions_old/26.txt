 This statistic displays the number of murder victims in the United States by race/ethnicity and gender in 2018. In 2018, 3,180 murder victims were female. Additional information on black/African American murder victims in the United StatesAccording to male deaths by firearm-related injuries by ethnicity, the amount of black victims has fallen by over half since 1970 in proportion to the population. While this improvement has been welcomed, black males remained twice as likely to be the victim of a gun related death compared with white males. This inequality has lead to a rise in political action and demonstration around what is perceived as inaction or ignorance over the issue by government and wider society. The high profile death of Trayvon Martin in Florida followed by the deaths at the hand of police Freddie Gray and Michael Brown served as the catalyst for such movements. The wider issue of violence beyond murder also appears to have systemic correlations. The percentage of violent crime victims with socio-emotional problems by race demonstrates that black Americans experienced socio-emotional issues at a greater rate. Moreover, the issue of a higher exposure to violence for black Americans stretches to the schooling system where 8.4 percent of black children were threatened or injured with a weapon in 2013.
