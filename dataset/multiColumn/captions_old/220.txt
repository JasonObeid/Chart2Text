 In 2018, South Korea had the highest smartphone penetration in the world at 95 percent, and mobile phone use was nearly ubiquitous. In the majority of countries where more than 90 percent owned a mobile phone, smartphone penetration is higher than 70 percent, which is somewhat of an indicator for an advanced economy. Smartphone user numbers are growing The number of global smartphone users has constantly been growing ever since the first smartphones hit the market, surpassing the three billion mark for the first time in 2019. This growth trend is forecast to continue over the next few years, adding several hundred million smartphone users annually to the global user base. As the sales of new smartphones have plateaued at around 1.5 billion units annually, the growth in user numbers is supported by a growing market for used and refurbished phones. Some estimates put the global market for used phones at 39 to 52 billion U.S. dollars by the early to mid 2020s.
