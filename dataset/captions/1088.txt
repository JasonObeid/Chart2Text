The Conservative party were the clear victors in the United Kingdom 's general election of 2019 , winning 365 seats out of 650 , meaning they now have a majority of 80 seats in the House of Commons . Boris Johnson will continue as Prime Minister , but in a far stronger position than before , while the leader of the Labour party , Jeremy Corbyn will resign before the next election . What does it mean for Brexit ? As a consequence of this result , the United Kingdom will almost certainly leave the European Union by the end of January 2020 .
