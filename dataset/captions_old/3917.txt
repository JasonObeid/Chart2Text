 This statistic shows the leading European life and health insurance companies on the market, ranked by market value (market capitalization) as of May 2019. In that time Prudential was the largest life and health insurer, with a market value of over 60 billion U.S. dollars. Market capitalization, also known as stock market value, is the total value of issued shares of a publicly traded company. It is equal to the share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding. It applies only to publicly traded companies or companies that have made their stock market debut, also known as the initial public offering, or an IPO. Due to the practice of buying and selling stock in public markets, market capitalization can be used as a proxy for the wider public’s opinion of a company’s net worth. According to the figures from mid May 2019, the second largest European life and health insurance company, with market value of approximately 22.6 billion U.S. dollars, was the UK company Legal & General Group. Interestingly enough, the top three life and health insurance companies based in Europe are all from with the United Kingdom.
