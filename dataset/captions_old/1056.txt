 In 2019, the unemployment rate in Bangladesh was at approximately 4.29 percent. After a decrease from 2010 through 2012, Bangladesh’s unemployment has been steady at around 4.4 percent. Stuck in the middle? In the Asia-Pacific region, Bangladesh’s economy is ranked somewhere in the middle, lower than Pakistan, but even higher than New Zealand. The same is true for gross national income (GNI) and about the same for unemployment (where it ranks eighth, behind China, Australia, and Afghanistan). But Bangladesh’s figures are not always seemingly mediocre: It is one of the most densely populated countries with one of the largest populations worldwide. On the way up Most of Bangladesh’s workforce is employed in the tertiary sector, which is gaining workers while the share of employed people in the primary sector, including agriculture, is decreasing. The country’s GDP is on a steady upswing, while inflation seems to recover and level off at around 5 percent for now. Bangladesh is, after all, one of the world’s fastest-growing economies.
