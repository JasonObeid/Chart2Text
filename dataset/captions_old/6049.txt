 This statistic depicts the volume of crude oil imported from Iran by its leading destination countries between January and June 2011. The European Union imported a total of around 450,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran during that period. Iran has stopped oil exports to France, where crude oil is the second most important energy source and Britain, where crude oil production has been declining since 2002.
