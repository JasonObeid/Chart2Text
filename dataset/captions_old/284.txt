 The Dallas Cowboys have the highest all-time winning percentage during the regular season of the National Football League. The franchise has an impressive win percentage of 57.3 percent. On the other end of the spectrum, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers find themselves in last place with a regular season win percentage of just 38.5 percent. Regular season evergreens With such a high win percentage during the regular season, it is no wonder that the Dallas Cowboys draw in big crowds – the average regular season attendance in the 2018 season stood at 91,619. This figure is almost 15,000 spectators more than the second-placed team, the New York Jets. However, although the Cowboys come out on top in terms of win percentage, it is the Chicago Bears who have won the highest number of regular season games, 749, in NFL history. This high number can be attributed to the fact that the Bears were founded way back in 1920 and are one of only two original remaining franchises from the NFL’s founding in 1920, the other being the Arizona Cardinals. Who shines in the postseason? While the regular season may lay the groundwork for success, it is during the postseason that the big teams flex their muscles. The New England Patriots lead the way in the number of wins in the postseason – their 37 wins currently put them two head of the chasing pack, which includes the Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers. It is unsurprising, then, that these usual suspects top the list of Super Bowl appearances – the Patriots are top of the pile, having reached the biggest game in football a record 11 times. Of these 11 visits to the Super Bowl, the Patriots have won six. This puts them level with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the highest number of Super Bowl wins of all time.
