 The average annual salary in the Netherlands in 2018 was just under 34,700 euros, including bonuses. The average employee reached his or her highest annual salary between the age of 45 and 49 years old, at over 45,000 euros. Up to that point, the average annual salary generally increased, from about 1,340 euros per year for those under 15, to 45,080 for those 45-49 years old. After that age, average annual salaries decreased again, to about 15,100 euros for those 75 years and older. Highest salaries in the mining and quarrying industry Those looking to make a substantial amount of money were best off in the mining and quarrying industry, where average annual wages reached nearly 83,000 euros in 2018. Employees in the electricity and gas supply sector earned roughly 62,000 euros, and those working in finance made nearly as much, at 62,200 euros. On the lower end of the scale, employees in the accommodation and food serving industry earned an average annual salary of only 13,700 euros, or over six times less than employees in the best-paying sector. Gender differences In general, annual salaries for men were considerably higher than salaries for women. Whereas men earned an average annual salary of over 42,000 in 2018, women in the Netherlands on average made about 26,200 euros annually. This was not just the result of men having a higher average hourly salary, to some extent this was also a consequence of women working fewer hours than men. Whereas men in the Netherlands on average worked 33.3 hours per week in 2018, women worked only 24.5 hours.
