 Indonesia was ranked first in the number of Facebook users among Southeast Asian countries in 2017. While this is mainly due to the population size, it also reflects the increasing popularity and widespread use of social media in Indonesia. Hence, it is not surprising that, as of 2018, the penetration rate of the other major social media platforms in Indonesia was on a high level too. Is Facebook still on the rise? The social network giant reported 2.32 billion monthly users for its services Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram as of 2018. Most of the members visited these platforms at least once a day, and Facebook was still accounting for a steady user increase. However, growth was already stagnating in the US, Canada and Europe. New users were mostly generated by India, Indonesia and the Philippines, which in turn makes these regions particularly important. Did the privacy scandal impact on the revenue? As of 2018, the negative impacts of the various scandals involving privacy violations were not noticeable in the turnover. In 2018 Facebook was able to increase its revenue per user to almost 25 U.S. dollars, whereas the total revenue rose to 55.8 billion dollars, most of which was generated through mobile ads. Sales in this area increased by almost 16 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 compared to the previous year. It remains to be seen how such scandals will impact Facebook as a multibillion-dollar company.
