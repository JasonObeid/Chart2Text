 Total visits to Smithsonian museums and institutions dropped slightly in 2018 to 28.5 million, down from 30 million in the previous year. What is the Smithsonian? The Smithsonian is a group of museums and research centers run by the U.S. Government and mostly based in the District of Columbia. Public entry to all Smithsonian museums is free, with funds being provided through federal budget appropriations and donations. In 2018 the National Air and Space Museum was the most visited of the Smithsonian institutions, attracting 6.3 million visitors in 2018. Museums in the U.S. and globally The Smithsonian is by far the largest not-for-profit cultural institution in United States, receiving over three times the revenue of the next largest, the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The comparison is perhaps a little misleading though, given that the Smithsonian is a group of institutions. If assessed in terms of a single institution, the Metropolitan Museum of Art has higher visitor numbers and any single Smithsonian museum, and in 2018 was the third-most visited art museum in the world.
