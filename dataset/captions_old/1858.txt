 This graph shows the results of the Happy Planet Index's ranking of the happiest and most environmentally sustainable countries in the world. The Happy Planet Index measures life expectancy, experienced well-being, inequality of outcomes, and ecological footprint in order to determine the countries that are able to deliver the longest and happiest, but also most sustainable lives to their residents. The Index works to measure efficiency by ranking countries relative to how they offer their people long and happy lives, for each unit of environmental output. In 2016, Costa Rica was ranked as the "happiest" country with a HPI score of 44.7.
