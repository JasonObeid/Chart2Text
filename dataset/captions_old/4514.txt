 This statistic shows gross domestic product (GDP) of the European Union from 2014 to 2024 in billion U.S. dollars. In 2018, the EU's GDP amounted to about 18.74 trillion U.S. dollars. Brexit and the economy of the European Union The European Union is still recovering from the crisis in 2008, but it is by no means making an impressive comeback and 2016 has not started out on the right foot either. Total GDP of the European Union staggered in 2012 and even moreso in 2015. Recent events are also bound to reduce consumer confidence and drag down growth. The year began with the economic slowdown in China and has continued on with the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union. The long term effects this decision is expected to have have an overall negative effect on GDP growth within the European Union. However, the effects will likely hit the UK and Ireland more so. By 2030, it is expected that the GDP growth of the European Union will be negative at around minus 0.36 percent. Even considering an optimistic scenario, GDP of the UK is expected to decrease by 2.72 percent by 2030, as well - a pessimistic forecast even reducing GDP growth to a 7.7 percent decrease. Yet, it is still too early to tell how Brexit will play out in reality, but it will almost certainly impact current future projections of GDP growth in the European Union and the Euro Area.
