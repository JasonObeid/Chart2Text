 The demand of eggs has grown in the United States over the last number of years. In 2019, consumption of eggs in the United States was estimated at 289.5 per person. This figure was projected to reach 289.9 eggs per capita by 2020. Per capita consumption is a measure of total egg production, less exports, divided by the total U.S. population. Cage-free and organic eggs Although the majority of laying hens in the Unites States are still caged, the production of organic and caged-free hens has increased in recent years. In cage-free production, hens are allowed to move freely outside of their cage, but this time is limited and the environment they are kept in could still be unhealthy and very crowded. In organic production however, hens are provided with free-range outdoor access. U.S. egg industry There has been steady growth in the number of eggs produced in the United States. Additionally, the total number of laying hens in the United States has also increased in recent years. Iowa was the U.S. state with the most laying hens, with some 57.5 million laying hens as of 2018.
