 During the period between 1931 and 1960, the number of live births in the United Kingdom peaked in 1947, where there were estimated to have been over one million births. By contrast, the year with the least births was 1941 when there were just 695 thousand births. These two figures are undoubtedly linked to the Second World War, with 1941 coming just after the Battle of Britain and 1947 being two years after the end of the war. Talking ‘bout the generations… Due to the higher number of births that occurred after the end of the Second World War, the so-called Baby Boomer Generation was still the largest in the United Kingdom as of 2015. They numbered around 14.8 million people in this year, dwarfing both Generation X and Millennials of which there were 13 million and 13.8 million respectively. Comparisons with other times While there were certainly a lot of births in 1947, the year with the highest number of births in twentieth century was 1920 when there were 1.1 million births. This came after a significant drop in the number of births that happened during the First World War, with every year prior to 1914 having over a million births. The 1960s was another period of relatively high births, but throughout the 1970s the figures fell and remained relatively low until the early 2010s.
