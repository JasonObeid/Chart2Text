 This statistic displays the annual exchange rate (average or standardized measure) of the euro to the Russian ruble (EURRUB), according to data from the European Central Bank, from the introduction of the euro in 1999 to 2019. The average, or standardized, measure shows the calculation based on observations throughout the period in question, which is different than an annual measure at point in time: concrete values as of the end of the year. Between the years of 2000 and 2016, the average annual exchange rate of the euro to the Russian ruble noted a steep increase. In 2009, the euro to Russian ruble annual average exchange rate was equal to 44.14, which meant that one euro could buy 44.14 Russian rubles. By 2016 this value had increased overall, to a value of 74.14 which meant that one euro could buy 74.14 Russian rubles. This increase in average annual euro to Russian ruble exchange rate is reflected in the monthly exchange rate in recent years. As of 2018 the average annual exchange rate of the euro to the Russian ruble was 74.04.
