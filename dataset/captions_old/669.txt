 In 2018/19 the crime rate in London was 95.99 crimes committed per thousand people. Since 2015/16 the crime rate in the United Kingdom capital has increased in every reporting year, with the steepest increase occurring between 2016/17 and 2017/18. Over 862 thousand crimes in 2018/19 Compared with 2013/14 there were around 161 thousand more crimes in 2018/19, a total of 862 thousand offences overall. Homicide offences accounted for 122 of these crimes, a decline of 41 when compared with the previous year, but nevertheless one of the worst years for homicides in London. Is rising crime linked to police cuts? The recent rise in crime in London has happened alongside a decline in both personnel and funding for the London Metropolitan Police. Compared with 2010 for example, there are around 2.2 thousand fewer police officers in 2018, while annual funding fell by around 40 million British pounds between 2012/13 and 2015/16.
