 In January 2020, Lombardy was the region in Italy hosting the largest share of immigrants (14 percent), followed by Emilia-Romagna, Lazio, and Piedmont. These regions are also the Italian regions with the highest number of inhabitants. For instance, in 2019, Lombardy counted ten million inhabitants (approximately one sixth of the total Italian population) and was housing 17 thousand immigrants. The Mediterranean route to Europe Between January and October 2019, almost seven hundred migrants died or went missing in the Italian Central Mediterranean Sea in the attempt to reach Europe. In 2019, 11.5 thousand people arrived on the Italian shores. In fact, the number of migrants decreased over the last years. However, the death and missing cases did not drop in proportion to the number of people who reached the coast. Racism on the rise in Italy Even if the number of migrants arriving in Italy dropped in the last years, race-related violence was on the rise. Among others, the cases of racial physical violence increased, in particular between 2016 and 2018. Over these three years, the cases of body violence ranged from 24 to 121 attacks. Similarly, insults, threats and harassments became more widespread. Between 2017 and 2018, the cases of verbal violence grew from 86 to 130.
