 Rice is one of the most popular grains in the United States, with Americans consuming around 4.29 million metric tons of rice in the 2018/2019 fiscal year. The consumption volume of rice in the United States has remained more or less stable between 2016 and 2019. Leading consumers of rice A high share of the world’s rice consumption is concentrated between a few countries, namely China, India, and Indonesia. China alone consumed around 143.79 million metric tons of rice in 2018/2019, while India consumed about 100 million metric tons in that time period. To put this figure in perspective, the global consumption volume of rice in 2018/2019 amounted to 490.27 million metric tons; about half of this volume was attributed to China and India. Rice milk and dairy alternatives Rice milk is one of the many ways to consume rice. Rice milk is produced using milled rice and water and is the least allergenic of all the dairy alternatives. However, it has a relatively small market value compared to more popular kinds of dairy milk alternatives such as almond milk and soy milk worldwide.
