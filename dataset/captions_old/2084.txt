 Since the first half of 2010, household electricity prices in Portugal have seen an overall increase, rising to 22.93 euro cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in the second half of 2018. The highest price during the reporting period was in the first half of 2016, at 23.5 euro cents per kWh. Households with an annual consumption of 2,500 kWh to 5,000 kWh tended to pay more for their electricity compared to those with a consumption of between 1,000 kWh and 2,499 kWh. International comparisons Portuguese households pay some of the highest prices for electricity across Europe. In 2018, average household electricity prices were only higher in Denmark, Germany, Belgium, Italy and Ireland. In addition to paying some of the highest prices in Europe, electricity prices in Portugal are higher than in many countries worldwide. In 2018, prices were more than twice as much as the average household paid in the United States. One reason for the high prices in Portugal is the high tax burden. Approximately 52 percent of the price of electricity is tax related. Renewable electricity Portugal has seen its share of renewable electricity generation grow over the past decade, increasing from 32.3 percent in 2007 to 54.1 percent by 2016. Shares rose above 50 percent for the first time in 2014.
