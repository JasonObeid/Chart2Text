 Manchester United are currently the record title winners in the English top flight having won the division a total of 20 times since 1889. They have also won the world’s oldest domestic soccer competition, the FA Cup, 12 times, most recently in 2016. This figure is surpassed only by Arsenal FC, who have lifted the cup 13 times. The London team pulled ahead of Manchester United after claiming their 13th title with a 2-1 victory against Chelsea in the 2016-17 season. Still Premier League giants? The majority of Manchester United’s championship wins came since the inception of the Premier League at the beginning of the 1992/93 season under the leadership of manager Sir Alex Ferguson. Indeed, United’s most recent title came in the 2012-13 season, which was Ferguson's final season of management before his retirement. This title drought will have been compounded by the fact that city rivals, Manchester City, claimed the Premier League trophy in 2018 and 2019. More than a football club Manchester United is undoubtedly one of the biggest football clubs in the world. While success on the pitch has been lacking in recent years, the value of the brand off the pitch continues to grow. The club generates considerable revenue from matchday activities and broadcasting; however, the largest revenue is generated in its commercial segment. This is unsurprising considering the club not only has a huge following in the United Kingdom but also across the world, most notably in Asia. The club generates millions of U.S. dollars in sponsorship and merchandising as fans want to show support for their team wherever they are in the world. The global nature of the club can be seen by the fact that the official Facebook page has over 73 million fans, considerably larger than the population of the whole of the United Kingdom.
