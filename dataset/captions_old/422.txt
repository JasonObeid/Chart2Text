 In 2019, Ford Fiesta was the best selling car model at 77,833 units. Currently in its seventh generation, it was first sold in 1979 and had been popular with UK consumers from the beginning. Two years after its introduction on the market, the Ford Fiesta Mk1 had already reached the peak of the most sold supermini cars. As seen in this statistic, three of the leading ten car models were produced by Ford, with the car manufacturer pushing ahead of Volkswagen, the only other manufacturer with more than one entry. In terms of car sales in the UK, by far the most profitable month for Ford was March, when the it had sold 40,755 units. Supermini still most popular car type This statistic shows that smaller and more compact cars still proved the most successful with customers. Superminis remain the most common car type in the country, though its popularity has been declining since 2015. Dual purpose and lower medium cars had seen the most significant growth in recent years, which is also reflected in the list of best selling cars – three entries are compact SUVs, while only two other entries are classified as supermini cars. New car registrations in decline Despite an increase in new car registrations following the recession, figures have been decreasing again since 2017. Uncertainty over Brexit and shortage in supply due to new emissions testing schemes were deemed responsible for this development. Forecasts suggest a continued decline, however the current political climate makes it difficult for the industry to offer conclusive predictions.
