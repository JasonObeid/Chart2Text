 With a brand value amounting to almost 13.7 million of U.S. dollars, the brand L’Oréal Paris leads this ranking of European cosmetic brands in 2016. The L’Oréal group is also represented by three other subsidiary companies, that is: Garnier, Maybelline and Lancôme. If the respective values were to be summed together with the value of L’Oréal Paris, the total brand value for the L’Oréal S.A. would amount to approximately 24.37 billion of U.S. dollars. L’Oréal is the leading personal care company in Europe not only by brand value but also by revenue In 2018, L’Oréal registered a revenue of 31.2 billion U.S. dollars, whereas only the beauty and personal care segment from the British-Dutch company, Unilever, attained 24.8 billion US dollars. In 2018, the L’Oréal Group also registered a higher global revenue than Beiersdorf, its closest competitor – that was represented on the brand value ranking by Nivea –: approximately 26.9 billion of US dollars for L’Oréal in comparison with Beiersdorf’s 7.2 billion dollars. L’Oréal managed to increase its volume of sales even after selling its socially and ecologically responsible subsidiary, The Body Shop, in 2017 to the Brazilian cosmetics company Natura. A decreasing market share in emergent cosmetics markets – a continuous trend? The company’s market share in emergent markets such as Brazil or China is less expressive than in Europe. Between 2015 and 2016, L’Oréal’s market share in the Brazilian color cosmetics retail market went from 9.8 percent to 9.2 percent. Through Maybelline and L’Oréal Paris, the L’Oréal group held a total of 27.7 percent of the market for color cosmetics in China in 2011. In 2014, the market share held by the two L’Oréal brands in China had decreased to 15.6 percent.
