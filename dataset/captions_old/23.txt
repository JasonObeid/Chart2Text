 The statistic shows the average prices for Boeing aircraft as of January 2019, by type. The 737-800 model had a list price of 106.1 million U.S. dollars. The Boeing 777-9 is the company’s most expensive model Along with Airbus, Embraer, and Bombardier Aerospace, Boeing is one of the world's four largest aircraft manufacturers. The maker of airplanes, rockets, satellites and rotorcraft is the global leader based on revenue. The Chicago-headquartered jet manufacturer greatly outperformed its main competitor, Airbus: Boeing generated over 100 billion U.S. dollars in revenue in 2018, compared to the 73 billion U.S. dollars (or about 63.7 billion euros) generated by Airbus. The competition between Boeing and Airbus has been intense over the years. With the exception of 2011, when Airbus received a staggering 1,608 orders, both companies have been receiving a somewhat comparable amount of orders since 2003. Boeing’s 737 aircraft series have emerged as the company’s best sellers, accounting for over 69 percent of all aircraft delivered worldwide by Boeing in 2017. That said, the Boeing 737 Max-8 was involved in a sequence of airplane crashes, and has thus been grounded in many countries around the world. The Boeing 737 twinjet narrow-body jet is a shorter, more economical model similar to Boeing’s 727 and 707. The Boeing 737-700, which costs just under 90 million U.S. dollars, is among the least expensive models, while the Boeing 777-9, priced at 442 million U.S. dollars, is among the most expensive ones on Boeing's price list.
