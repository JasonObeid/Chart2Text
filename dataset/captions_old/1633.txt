 This statistic shows the share of consumers agreeing with statements regarding their habits while shopping, according to a survey conducted with UK consumers in 2016. Of respondents, over 81 percent stated that they look at products in stores but subsequently go online to find the best price, and nearly 52 percent tended to use the same retailers on a regular basis. The most popular day for browsing online and doing shopping is shown to be Sunday, where as the least popular day is Friday. The internet is not the only way people shop, as people still visit their local high street about the same amount as they did the previous year. With regards to researching of products, people who want to buy electrical items do so over 50 percent of the time via online shops. This number is significantly less for people who shop for clothes, where only 30 percent of people do their research online prior to in-store shopping.
