 From a former royal residence to the word’s largest museum, the Louvre is one of the most popular cultural sites in Paris – attracting more then 10 million visitors in 2018 alone. The most visited museum in the world Like a lot of other touristic sites in France, the Louvre Museum experienced a decline in attendance after the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. In 2016, only 7.3 million tourists visited the museum compared to 8.6 million the year before. Similar decreases in attendance had been observed at the Musée d’Orsay or in the number of tourists visiting the Eiffel Tower that same year. However, with a record 10.2 million visitors in 2018, the Louvre was the most visited museum worldwide in 2017 and the third most visited cultural site in Paris. The recovery of tourism in France With exhibitions like “Delacroix”, dedicated to French artist Eugène Delacroix, the Louvre is successful in attracting tourists from all over the world. The good health of the Louvre mirrors the recovery of tourism in France and in Paris. The number of international tourists arriving in Paris, as well as the number of domestic tourist arrivals have increased since 2016. The contribution of travel and tourism to GDP in France is supposed to increase in the future as France keeps being one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world.
