 Iconic U.S. national monument the Statue of Liberty was visited by 4.24 million people in 2019, down from the previous year’s visitation figure by around two percent. Visitation reached a dramatic low in 2013 due to closure of the monument as a result of damage caused by Hurricane Sandy. A national treasure becomes a national monument The U.S. government granted the statue national monument status in 1924. Around 10 years later it was entrusted to the care of the National Parks Service – it has remained in its care to this day. Along with Liberty Island, Ellis island (famous for its past as a federal immigration station) also joined as part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument. Since then, visitors to Ellis Island are included in the visitor count of The Statue of Liberty. Not the only popular attraction… The popularity of the Statue of Liberty is undeniable, with many other attractions not reaching similar visitation figures. One of these being Mount Rushmore (South Dakota), which welcomed just below half the number of visitors of the Statue of Liberty in 2019. That being said, the Lincoln Memorial (Washington DC) garnered almost double the number of visitors of the Statue of Liberty in the same year.
