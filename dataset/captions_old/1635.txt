 The median age of the population of Singapore has been increasing since 1965, and is projected to reach 42.2 years by 2020. The median age is the age that divides a population into two numerically equal groups, such that half the people are younger than this age and half are older. An aging population As Singapore’s median age increases, its fertility rate has decreased. In 2017, Singapore’s fertility rate was 1.16 children per woman of childbearing age, which is below the amount needed to replace the population. Additionally, Singapore is one of the leading countries and territories with the highest life expectancy at birth; an expectancy of 87.5 years. As such, Singapore is faced with adapting to aging population and a growing ratio of old-age dependency. A trend of population aging Many countries are facing this demographic dilemma: the global median age is projected to grow from 29.6 in 2015 to around 41.6 years through the end of the century. Population aging could be one of the most substantial societal transformations of the twenty-first century, affecting most sectors of society, including healthcare, housing, and pensions.
