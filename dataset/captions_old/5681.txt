 The problem of unemployment in Italy became critical in the first years of the financial crisis which started in 2008. Although the labor market crisis seriously affected the entire Italian working population, it particularly impacted the youngest part of the labor force. Between 2008 and 2014 alone, the share of unemployed individuals aged between 15 and 24 years increased by more than 15 percent. Despite a steady decline observed after 2014, youth unemployment still stood at almost 29 percent in 2019. Dream job versus harsh reality Newly graduated and often looking for a first job, young people are particularly vulnerable to stagnation in the labor market. Considering the difficulties in finding a job during and after the years of the financial crisis, about 48 percent of young Italians declared in 2018 that they would accept a job that does not meet their career aspiration. One fourth of the respondents stated that they would a accept a monthly salary of 500 euros. Greece and Italy with have the highest youth unemployment rates in the EU With about 33 percent of potential young workers without a job, Italy was the country with the second highest youth unemployment rate among the EU member states at the beginning of 2019. The country with the highest youth unemployment was Greece, where about four in ten young individuals were unemployed.
