 In the fourth quarter of 2019, Korean consumer electronics company Samsung Electronics reported an operating profit of nearly 7.16 trillion Korean Won or around 6.5 billion U.S. dollars. Many of the company’s segments experienced increases in their overall sales numbers in the third quarter of 2019, but growing competition throughout the consumer electronics industry meant that profitability fell. Samsung Samsung ranks among the largest companies in the world in terms of market value and is perhaps best known for its various lines of successful consumer electronics products. The company’s biggest segment is its mobile communications business which primarily focuses on smartphone products such as the new Samsung Galaxy Fold. In addition to its own Samsung-branded products, the company also serves as the display manufacturer for many other devices in the consumer electronics market. The company employs hundreds of thousands of workers and accounts for a significant portion of South Korea’s GDP, meaning that Samsung is massively influential within both its home country and throughout the world.
