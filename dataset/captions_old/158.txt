 In the fourth quarter of 2019, Google's revenue amounted to 45.8 billion U.S. dollars, up from 40.34 billion U.S. dollars in the preceding quarter. Google's main revenue source is advertising through Google sites and its network. In 2019, Google accounted for the majority of parent company Alphabet's revenues with 113.26 billion U.S. dollars in Google website ad revenues alone. The majority of Google’s revenue comes from advertising through Google owned and operated properties such as Google Search, Google Maps and more. Revenues generated from Google’s network member’ websites include revenue from ads served through advertising programs such as AdSense for AdSearch for example. Other revenue include digital content products and apps sold through Google’s Play digital content distribution platform, as well as hardware include Chromecast devices and smartphones. Digital content platform Google Play is an increasingly important contributor to Google’s bottom line, especially as smartphones sales and Google’s Android platform’s global market share increase. Geographically, the biggest single country share of Google’s revenue comes from the United States, and 31 percent of revenues are generated from the EMEA region.
