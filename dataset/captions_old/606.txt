 In the fourth quarter of 2019, there were 18.13 million Bitcoins in the world. Bitcoin is a virtual currency. It can be bought and sold through online exchanges or ATMs. Since the technology is still new, retailers are still reluctant to accept payment in Bitcoin. Currency or asset? Bitcoin’s use in making transactions is a minor factor in what motivates consumers to invest in Bitcoin. More are interested in the technology behind the currency or see it as an investment. As such, many pay more attention to indicators such as market capitalization, trying to use Bitcoin’s volatility to profit. This volatility makes Bitcoin an attractive albeit risky investment, but it may be a major factor in merchants’ reluctance to use it for transactions. The cryptocurrency market Bitcoin is no longer the only virtual currency in circulation. Other leading virtual currencies include Tether, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Users “mine” these currencies by leasing computing power, which is used in processing transactions in exchange for a portion of the currency. In spite of growing competition, Bitcoin is still the dominant player for the time being.
