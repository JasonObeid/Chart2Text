 This statistic displays the annual exchange rate (average or standardized measure) of the euro to the Chinese Yuan Renminbi (EUR CNY), according to data from the European Central Bank, from the early days of the euro in 2001 up until 2019. The average, or standardized, measure shows the calculation based on observations throughout the period in question, which is different than an annual measure at point in time: this denotes concrete values as of the end of the year. Between the years of 2001 and 2007, the average annual exchange rate of the euro to the Chinese Yuan Renminbi noted an overall increase. In 2007, the euro to Chinese Yuan Renminbi annual average exchange rate was equal to 10.42, which meant that one euro could buy 10.42 Chinese Yuan Renminbi. By 2019, this value had decreased overall, to a value of 7.74, which meant that one euro could buy 7.74 Chinese Yuan Renminbi.
