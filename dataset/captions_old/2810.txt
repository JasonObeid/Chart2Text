 In 2019, Volvo was the most popular car brand in Sweden. During that year, over 65 thousand passenger cars were sold, which was a decrease of more than four thousand cars compared to the previous year. Another car brand, which also experienced a decline in sales demand from 2018 to 2019, was Volkswagen with nearly 49 thousand sold units. Global yet traditional The Volvo Group is one of the world’s leading vehicle manufactures with production departments in 18 different countries. Volvo was founded in 1927 in Gothenburg, Sweden. In 1977, the company began expanding to the European market, when several manufacturing plants saw the light of day. In 2019, the two Volvo companies, Volvo AB and Volvo Car AB, accounted for the highest turnovers of Swedish companies at more than 500 million Swedish kronor in total. A trustworthy brand Despite being a global company, Volvo has remained relevant in its mother country. To this day, Volvo still has its headquarter in Gothenburg, where the company employs roughly 100,000 people, making it the fourth biggest employer in Sweden. Furthermore, the company is publicly-held; something which might explain why Volvo ranked high, when the Swedes were asked about their trust in big companies. These positive connotations were also found with younger generations of Swedes, who gave Volvo the tenth highest rank among Swedish brands in 2019.
