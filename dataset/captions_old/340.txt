 In the fiscal year of 2018, China was the largest sales market for BMW. China accounted for almost 26 percent of Rolls-Royce, BMW, and MINI sales. Chinese customers bought about 640,800 such vehicles in the 2018 fiscal year. This is more than twice as many vehicles as were snapped up by motorists in Germany. U.S. consumers are losing interest in MINI Between the 2014 and 2018 fiscal years, BMW sales in the United States fell from almost 400,000 to about 356,000 units. While BMW’s small MINI hatchbacks were never going to take the U.S. market by storm, nobody at BMW will have foreseen the low and disappointing sales figures of May 2019: MINI sales dropped 33.2 percent in May 2019 over May 2018. The luxury car maker’s revenue, too, is indicative of tepid year-on-year growth in the United States, as well as negative growth in the European market. However, it should be noted that BMW’s overall year-end sales figures in the United States increased in 2018 over 2019. Additionally, BMW-branded vehicle sales in the U.S. had risen for the 14th month straight in December 2018.
