 Scooter and moped sales amounted to over 25,000 units in 2019. March and September recorded the highest sales, which were the months when the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency issued new registration plates for cars and motorcycles. In December 2019, 1,383 scooters and mopeds were sold in the United Kingdom. This was a noticeable decrease compared to the same month in the two years prior and indicative of an overall negative sales trend. Scooter sales When looking at sales of scooters and mopeds individually, scooters clearly come out on top. In December 2018, they accounted for 74 percent of combined sales. However, the number of new scooters registered also fell noticeably since 2016. Most popular motorcycle types Scooters were still one of the most popular motorcycle types in the country, although registration figures saw a net decline between 2014 and 2018. Naked or standard motorcycles recorded the greatest sales numbers, making them the leading motorcycles in the UK.
