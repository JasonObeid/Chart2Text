 This statistic shows the average inflation rate in Chile from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the average inflation rate in Chile had amounted to about 2.32 percent compared to the previous year. Chile's slowing economy The inflation rate in Chile has fluctuated from a low of 1.41 percent in 2010 to a high of 4.39 percent as of 2014. Despite the central bank having issued a target inflation rate of 3 percent, it was not reached in 2014, 2015 or 2016, defying expectations. Rising inflation is said to be affected by a weakening peso, combined with a relatively weak economy. While these inflation rates are not nearly comparable to some of the highest inflation rates around the world, slow growth and a lack of consumer and business confidence remain an underlying concern in Chile. Annual economic growth remains low at around two percent per year, fueling this concern. Further, export values are also in a slump as are those for imports, and this slow growth has had a significant effect on GDP growth per capita: In 2013, GDP per capita was around 15,713 U.S. dollars per capita, and in 2016 it is expected to drop by almost a fifth. In response, this year Chile has introduced a number of measures to help boost the economy, and 2016 is supposed to be the “Year of Productivity” with hopes of increasing trade and investment to raise growth and wages.
