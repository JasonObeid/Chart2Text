 In 2017, the poverty headcount ratio at 3.20 U.S. dollars a day in Brazil amounted to 9.6 percent, which means that almost 10 percent of the Brazilian population was living on less than 3.20 U.S. dollars per day. The poverty rate has increased since 2014, when the headcount ratio was below seven percent.
