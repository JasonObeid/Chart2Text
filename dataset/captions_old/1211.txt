 In 2017, about 5.07 million babies were born in the European Union, a slight decrease from the year before. Of those 5.06 million, some 785,000 were born in Germany, the most of any EU member state. Live births are the births of children excluding stillbirths; a key figure that can provide insight to demographic analyses, such as population growth. Population growth in Europe Europe is the continent with the second highest life expectancy at birth and has favorable living conditions due to factors such as a stable economy, and a high quality of public health and medical care. The European Union’s population has remained securely around 500 million inhabitants, though it has been increasing slowly from 2008 to 2018. The country with the highest number of foreign-born residents in 2018 was Germany, with 13.7 million people. Managing an influx of refugees In recent years, the European Union has received an increase in immigrants and refugees, especially during the period beginning in 2015 known as the European refugee crisis. Factors influencing this increased immigration to Europe include violence, drought, and poverty in source countries. The EU country hosting the highest number of refugees right now is Germany, with over 970,000 people.
