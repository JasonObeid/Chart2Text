 Approximately 28.7 million arrivals were recorded at travel accommodation in Greece in 2018. International tourism was the highest contributor, with around two thirds of arrivals in visitor accommodation coming from a foreign country. Greece tourism growth Since 2009 international visitor numbers to Greece have steadily increased. Including both overnight and same-day visitors, figures reached over 30 million by 2017. Greece has long been a popular destination for beach vacations. Situated in southern Europe and spread across hundreds of islands, the region is also a major area for cruise and sea tourism. Tourism’s role in Greek debt crisis recovery Tourism is essential to the Greek economy. It became a lifeline following the government debt crisis that saw the country fall into recession in late 2009, resulting in an emergency bailout from the EU. Although Greece exited the eurozone bailout in 2018, tourism continues to play a role in aiding the country’s ongoing economic recovery. Vacation crowds are still attracted to summer hotspots such as Crete, the Ionian Islands and the South Aegean regions. In 2018, travel and tourism was estimated to have directly contributed 15.1 billion euros to GDP in Greece.
