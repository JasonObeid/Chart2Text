 In the last decade, the average age of the Dutch population increased year on year. Whereas the population had an average age of nearly 40 years in 2009, ten years later the average age reached 42 years. As a result, in this period the grey population pressure (the ratio of the non-working population compared to the working population) increased as well, by over eight percentage points. Historical development Since the 1950s, the average age of the population has increased significantly. In nearly 70 years, the population’s average age grew by over ten years. This also caused a more than doubling of the grey population pressure in the country in this period, from 14 percent in 1950 to 32.6 percent in 2019. By 2060, the grey population pressure in the Netherlands is forecast to reach nearly 50 percent, meaning that for every working person in the country, there will also be a non-working person. Comparison to Belgium The average age of the population in the Netherlands was comparable to the average age of the population in neighboring country Belgium, which reached 41.6 years in 2018. In Belgium too, the average age of the population is expected to increase in the future. By 2020, the average age here is forecast to reach nearly 41.9 years.
