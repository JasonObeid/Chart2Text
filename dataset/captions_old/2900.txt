Almost half of Scots married In 2017, 47 percent of Scots were either married or in a civil partnership, with a further 36 percent of people being single. Divorced and widowed Scots both made up seven percent of the population each, while separated but still legally married Scots accounted for just two percent of the population in this year. For Scots who were married, 33 percent were aged between 45 and 59 with the next most common age group being those aged between 60 and 74 at 28 percent of married people. Divorces in Decline There were only 7.9 thousand divorces in Scotland in 2016/17, a net decrease of 5.8 thousand divorces than there were ten years earlier in 2006/07. Although that year saw a spike in the number of divorces, they declined in ever year since then, leading to the relatively few divorces seen in 2016/17.
