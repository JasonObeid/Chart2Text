 This statistic displays the monthly exchange rate (as of the end of each month, at closing) of the euro to the U.S. dollar (EUR USD), according to data provided by the European Central Bank, from January 2014 to February 2020. The concrete, or point in time, measure shows the exchange rate as of the last day of each month, which is different to the standardized measure; that denotes a calculation of average based on many observations throughout the period in question. Foreign exchange rates can be affected by a number of factors. Country inflation rates, public debts, current account deficits, interest rates, terms of trade between countries and, political stability and economic performance all factor into the exchange rate. During the period under observation, the euro saw a peak in January of 2018 when one euro could be exchanged for 1.25 U.S. dollars. Since that point the Euro has seen an overall fall towards February 2020 where it stands at 1.1 U.S. dollars to the euro.
