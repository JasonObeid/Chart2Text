 While rivals, Manchester City, may have run off with the Premier League trophy, it was city neighbors, Manchester United, who topped the average attendance table in the 2018/2019 season. An average of 74,879 watched every home match at Old Trafford, meaning that the Red Devils more or less sold out the stadium for every one of the Premier League home games. Best league in the world? Premier League attendances have been on the rise for the last decade, with the 2017/18 season representing a peak in the figures. Some 38,484 fans on average attended each home game of that season. Whilst these are impressive figures for a league often dubbed the best in the world, they pale in comparison to those of the German Bundesliga. Almost 45,000 fans attended an average game in Germany’s top league, with the highest average attendance found at Borussia Dortmund’s Signal Iduna Park. Manchester United’s supremacy in danger? While they remain the most successful Premier League team of all time, Manchester United has found success hard to come by in recent years. Indeed, United’s most recent title came back in the 2012-13 season, which was legendary manager, Sir Alex Ferguson’s, final season of management before his retirement. This title drought in recent years will only have been compounded by the fact that local rivals, Manchester City, were crowned champions in both 2018 and 2019. However, the Red Devils can take solace in the fact that the club remains one of the most valuable brands in world soccer..
