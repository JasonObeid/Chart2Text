 Aviation and power are the largest contributors to General Electric’s revenue, which was over 125 billion U.S. dollars in the 2018 fiscal year, up from 27 billion U.S. dollars one year before. This three percent increase from 2017 made it the 18th largest firm in the U.S. in 2018 and the biggest company in Massachusetts. Wings over GE 2017 saw a sudden departure the long time CEO and there has never been any consistent year-on-year growth. However, the strong performance from its aviation business this year, 12 percent up from 2017, has made a huge difference in confidence for the conglomerate. Looking forward, it is the ever struggling power business that is likely to be focused on after revenue declined by 22 percent from the previous year but GE will also have the emerging markets of Asia and Africa in their sights. However, in the renewable energy group, there is cause for celebration. General Electric were the number one producer of on-shore wind turbines (over 40,000 units) that year, and revenue grew by four percent. Future wind power generation is expected to continue to grow in the U.S. albeit, unfortunately for the renewable energy team, not at the rate they have seen in more recent times.
