 In recent years the number of nail salons in the United States has been shrinking, with there being a total of 54,386 salons nation-wide in 2018. This compares to 56,886 salons in 2017 and 69,738 salons in 2016. Nail salons Nail salons are distinguished from general beauty salons in that they offer primarily nail care services, with gel-polish, manicures and pedicures being the most common services offered. Prices for these services generally range between 20 and 50 U.S. dollars – much lower than for many other beauty treatments. Despite this low unit price the industry is capable of generating significant revenue, with over eight billion U.S. dollars being spent on nail care services in the U.S. every year since 2013. Nail salon employment Sources differ in determining how many people are employed in the U.S nail care industry. On one count, using a broader definition of nail technician, the industry employed just over 395,000 people in 2018. However, using a stricter definition of manicurists and pedicurists, another count puts this figure at just over 110,000. Aside from the differing definitions used, this discrepancy is likely affected by: the decentralized nature of the industry, with many salons being small, independent businesses; inconsistent registration requirements between different states; and the nature of the workforce itself, which includes many recent immigrants, some of which are undocumented (and therefore likely not reported as employees).
