 Mass media corporation 21st Century Fox generated 30.4 billion U.S. dollars in revenue in the fiscal year 2018, up from 28.5 billion U.S. dollars in the previous year. The company made over half of its revenue in cable network programming in 2018 and a further 8.75 billion U.S. dollars was derived from its filmed entertainment segment. The acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney 21st Century Fox consisted of News Corporations's former TV and film divisions after the split from the News Corp. in June 2013. In 2017, it was announced that Disney was making plans to acquire assets from 21st Century Fox’s entertainment and broadcast/satellite divisions. The acquisition was completed after a brief but high-profile bidding war between rivals Disney and Comcast, the latter of which ended its part in the proceedings by announcing the company would instead continue to seek stakes in Sky. Disney completed its acquisition of the company’s film and entertainment assets in early 2019 for around 71 billion U.S. dollars, also taking over 20th Century Fox, the movie studio responsible for the X-Men Universe as well as both ‘Avatar’ movies. There have been concerns regarding Disney’s increasing domination over the Hollywood landscape and the company’s unquenchable desire for expansion – Disney is even due to release its own streaming service to rival Netflix in 2019.
