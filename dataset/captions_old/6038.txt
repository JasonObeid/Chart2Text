 This statistic shows the average inflation rate in Nicaragua from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. In 2018, the average inflation rate in Nicaragua amounted to about 4.97 percent compared to the previous year. Nicaragua's economy Nicaragua’s inflation rate has been on the decline since 2011, but it is expected to rise again in 2016. In 2011, the country's economy experienced higher than average annual growth, which most likely helped increase consumer confidence and may have correlated with a decrease in the inflation rate. In general, consumer confidence is rising because GDP per capita has also been increasing steadily and is expected to continue to do so in the future. However, living conditions of Nicaraguans are still far from ideal, and the country struggles to overcome its reputation as one of the poorest nations in the region. GDP per capita in Nicaragua remained under 2,000 U.S. dollars per capita in 2014; only a fraction of GDP for Latin America and the Caribbean as a whole, which was slightly over 10,000 U.S. dollars per capita that same year. Yet, while per capita GDP is low, the country reports average unemployment and typically, when unemployment is low, consumer confidence increases and prices rise. However, it is likely that any increase in inflation will still have a significant effect on the poor, even if GDP rises.
