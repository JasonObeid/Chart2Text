 In December 2019, Negin Mirsalehi had the most followers of all Dutch Instagram influencers. This according to data provided by InfluencerDB. The Iranian-Dutch fashion blogger fits in a larger trend: Dutch influencers either have a background in music (such as rappers Lil’ Kleine and Boef), or they were involved in beauty or fashion. Examples of the latter category were bodybuilder and DJ Tavi Castro, Moroccan Dutch “Mimi” or Meryem van Os-Karin, Monica Geuze, “Gio” or Giovanni Latooy and television presenter Nicolette van Dam. FC Barcelona footballer Lieke Martens showed up as the only sports-related entry in the ranking. Instagram ranks among the most used apps in the Netherlands. A noticeable absentee from this list is Dutch makeup artist Nikki de Jager (otherwise known as "Nikkietutorials"), who had over 12 million followers on Instagram. The source does not mention why she was excluded, although it might have to do with the location where the influencer currently lives. Instagram sees a lot of exposure in the Netherlands The numbers provided in this ranking indicate worldwide followers of Dutch Instagrammers. This does not mean, however, they do not have an audience in the Netherlands. The online reach of the brand Instagram, usually defined in marketing as the percentage of visitors that visited specific content at least once during a certain period, was over 50 percent in January 2019. Relative high usage compared to other countries in Western Europe When compared to the rest of Europe, the Netherlands ranked among the top countries when it came to Instagram use. At the end of 2018, only Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Turkey saw a larger share of their population that used the photo application.
