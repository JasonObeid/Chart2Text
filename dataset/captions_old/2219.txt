 Around 25.9 million arrivals were recorded at accommodation establishments in Portugal in 2018. Over the last five years arrivals in tourist accommodation have been increasing at a higher rate, with an extra ten million arrivals in 2018 compared to 2013. Tourism development in Portugal The tourism industry makes a significant contribution to Portugal’s economy. As the country came out of recession and tourism began to increase, the Portuguese government launched a ten-year plan to boost the number of overnight stays by 2027. Although figures already show a positive trend in both international and domestic tourism annually, there are still challenges. For instance, arrivals from the United Kingdom, Portugal’s main travel market, are expected to slow down due to Brexit. Portugal’s popularity From a tourism perspective, Portugal benefits from both urban and resort destinations. Tourism demand is highest in the city destinations of Lisbon and Porto, plus coastal destinations such as the Algarve and the island of Madeira. Occupancy rates in Lisbon and Porto rank among the leading ten for city destinations in Europe.
