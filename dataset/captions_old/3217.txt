 According to a 2019 survey, support for the use of nuclear energy for electricity generation in the UK outweighed opposition. Of respondents, 35 percent supported its use, compared to 23 percent who opposed it. Despite nuclear disasters occurring as recently as 2011, when a tsunami hit a power plant in Fukushima, Japan, approximately 34 percent of UK residents believe it provides a safe source of energy. Role in the energy mix As of 2017, nuclear power made up approximately 21 percent of the UK’s electricity generation, showing its importance in the energy mix. However, renewable shares have been increasing significantly in recent years, and in 2014 overtook nuclear power for the first time ever. As this energy source’s share increased further, nuclear power shares decreased when compared to 2016. Nuclear powers future in the UK uncertain In recent years, the UK government had championed nuclear power as a reliable and low carbon source of electricity, to be used for many years to come. However, it now faces an uncertain future. In addition to power plants nearing the end of their life cycle, new multi-billion-pound projects have been scrapped. 2018 saw Toshiba withdraw from the Mooreside nuclear power station project, and Hitachi suspended work on the Wylfa project in Anglesey, North Wales in 2019.
