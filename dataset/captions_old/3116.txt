 Berlin-based online fashion retailer Zalando is one of the fastest-growing companies not just in Germany, but in Europe. While its active customer base expands with each year, Zalando’s annual net income suffered a major blow in the financial year 2018, going from 101.6 million to 51.2 million euros between 2017 and 2018. A great turnaround in 2014 Zalando delivered its sunniest results in 2015, when its net income equaled 121.5 million euros as displayed in this chart. After four consecutive years of loss, Zalando’s online fashion business flourished, which was helped by the company’s foray into various European markets. Not just online Besides its primary online business, Zalando also sells its products in its brick-and-mortar stores “Zalando Outlets” in five locations across Germany. Keen on bridging online and physical retail, the company announced later in 2018 that more Zalando Outlet stores in different German cities were on their way to meet customers.
