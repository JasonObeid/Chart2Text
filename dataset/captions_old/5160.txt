 Since 2005, the United Kingdom’s demand for electricity has been in decline, and by 2018 had fallen to a low of 352,064 gigawatt-hours. This is despite the population of the United Kingdom increasing by approximately five million people during this time. Some factors for this decline are energy efficiency regulations, energy-efficient lighting and changing consumer habits. Household electricity consumption In 2017, the average domestic electricity consumption per household varied from region to region. Consumption was highest in the South West of England with an average of 4,279 kilowatt hours, and lowest in the North East. Electricity generation in decline As with electricity demand, electricity generation has also been decreasing. In 2018, the amount of electricity generated by the United Kingdom fell to the lowest levels since 1994. Although electricity generation has been in decline, renewable generation has increased significantly. Projections for the year 2035 estimate renewable sources will account for 48 percent of all electricity generation. By 2030, the use of coal is expected to have been phased out.
