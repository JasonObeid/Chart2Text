 The statistic shows the percent of households in the United Kingdom (UK) that own a dishwasher from 1994 to 2018. In 1994, when this survey was initiated, 18 percent of households owned a dishwasher. As of 2018, that number has increased significantly to 49 percent of households. The market penetration was highest in the most recent year. Dishwashers are electronically powered machines that wash dishware and cutlery using hot water and detergent. Dishwashers first became domestically available and popular in the 1950s. Of course, at first dishwashers were a technology mainly available to the wealthy. Some nations seem to make use of dishwashers more than others. Germany for example has quite a high penetration compared to the UK. Imports of dishwashers into the UK have been on the rise in recent years, whereas exports have seen a slight decline in recent years. Dishwashers are very popular in the hotel and restaurant industry, since efficiency and speed of services are a high priority.
