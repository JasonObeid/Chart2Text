 The online gaming platform, Steam, was first released by the Valve Corporation in 2003. What started off as a small platform for Valve to provide updates to its games has turned into the largest computer gaming platform in the world. The platform initially released just seven games in 2004, but this number has progressively risen in the ensuing years, reaching a staggering 9,050 in 2018. Steam’s PC dominance When you think of PC gaming, you automatically think of Steam. With such a wide range of games on offer from traditional online multiplayer shooters to farming simulators, there is something for every gaming taste on the platform. As a result, gamers flock to Steam in their millions, with the platform registering 18.5 million peak concurrent users in 2018. Steam generated 4.3 billion U.S. dollars in game sales in 2017, marking a dramatic increase from the 1.5 billion U.S. dollars of revenue generated in 2014. The global nature of the platform can be seen by the wide range of languages spoken by its users. Whilst English remains the dominant language, a combined 35 percent of Steam users in 2019 stated that their main language was either Chinese or Russian. Steam’s biggest games PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) was the most popular game on Steam during 2018. The battle royale game averaged almost 853 thousand players per hour, almost twice the figure of its closest competitor, DOTA 2. The game also topped the 2018 list for peak number of concurrent players - PUBG reached more than 3.2 million players in a single hour in its peak, with DOTA 2 once more claiming second place.
