 Volkswagen Group’s revenue reached a peak in the 2018 fiscal year. The carmaker’s 236 billion euros in revenue also secured VW a spot in the ranking of the wealthiest companies worldwide. Key brand The Volkswagen Passenger Cars division represented the largest contributor to the company’s revenue with a revenue share of about 36 percent in 2018. The flagship brand mainly has hatchbacks, convertibles, and sedans, as well as an array of minivans and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in its product line-up. Key market While Volkswagen’s sales in Germany were flat during the past couple of years, Asia-Pacific has emerged as VW’s largest target market. Consumers in China and Hong Kong bought almost ten times as many Volkswagen-badged cars as car shoppers in the United States. Volkswagen’s Audi premium brand was slightly more popular with U.S. customers, who purchased a little over 220,000 Audi sedans in 2018. This figure compares to around 660,000 Audi sales in China and Hong Kong.
