 This statistic illustrates the hotel occupancy rate in Rome from 2011 to 2019. The occupancy rate of hotels in the city was measured at 70 percent in 2017. Rates are forecast to remain stable in 2018 and rise by one percentage point in 2019. Steeped in history and culture, Italy’s capital city Rome is a leading European city destination for international tourism, ranking above other popular Italian cities including Florence, Milan and Venice. Major international tourist markets visiting Rome include the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. Although occupancy rates were lower than in other major European cities in 2017, hotel occupancy in Rome has continued to remain stable and hotel performance overall shows a positive trend. Looking at other key hotel industry performance measures, the revenue per available room (RevPar) in Rome has been slowly increasing, as well as the average daily room rate (ADR), both of which are expected to show growth in 2018 and 2019. Occupancy rates are a key measure of performance in the hotel industry. They are calculated by dividing the number of occupied rooms by the number of available rooms and multiplying by 100 to form a percentage.
