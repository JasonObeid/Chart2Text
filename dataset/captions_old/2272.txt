 Cats and dogs are European households’ favorite animals to keep, although more unconventional choices such as reptiles and small mammals are chosen as pets in high numbers too. In 2018, the population of pet cats in Europe was over 103 million. Germany and France were the two countries where the number of cats was the highest. What about dogs? The number of dogs in Europe was lower than the number of cats, although dogs are a constant presence for a considerable share of Europeans as well. As recently as 2017, about one in five households in Europe owned at least one pet dog. Although dog ownership per household showed a decline compared to previous years, the number of dogs in Europe generally increased.

In Western Europe, the market value of pet care was estimated to be on the rise with more growth predicted for the future. Typically, pet care products consist of pet food as well as accessories and veterinary supplies.
