 The total average hospital bill for U.S. births varies depending on the kind of birth. In 2013, the average cost of an uncomplicated vaginal birth was around 32 thousand U.S. dollars. For a standard Cesarean section birth the cost was near 51 thousand U.S. dollars at that time. Cesarean sections are performed via the surgical removal of an infant from the mother. Birth costs The United States has one of the highest birthing costs in the world. The average hospital and physician costs for a normal vaginal delivery in the United States may cost twice as much as a normal vaginal birth in Australia. Cesarean sections costs are more expensive than vaginal births, but the cost difference is similar. The United States, followed by Switzerland, had the highest costs among select countries for C-section deliveries. Birth rates and mother's ageThe birth rate in the United States has decreased dramatically in recent history. Some evidence suggests that birth rates may be impacted by family income. According to recent data, lower incomes have higher birth rates in the United States. Birth rates were highest among women aged 20 to 34 years. However, there is an increasing tendency of mothers being older at the time of their first birth.
