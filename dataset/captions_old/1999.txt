 2018 saw the largest expenditures on Medicaid in U.S. history. At that time about 629.3 billion U.S. dollars were expended on the Medicaid public health insurance program that aims to provide affordable health care options to low income residents and people with disabilities. Medicaid was signed into law in 1965. By 1966 just under 1 billion U.S. dollars were spent on the program. Groups covered by Medicaid There are several components of the Medicaid health insurance program. The Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) was started in 1997 to provide health coverage to families and children that could not afford care. As of 2016, children represented the largest distribution of Medicaid enrollees. Despite having the largest proportion of enrollees, those that were enrolled in Medicaid as children had the lowest spending per enrollee. As of 2016, disabled Medicaid enrollees had the highest spending per enrollee. Medicaid expenditures Currently, Medicaid accounts for 17 percent of all health care expenditure in the United States. Expenditures on Medicaid programs vary among the U.S. states and depend heavily on whether Medicaid expansion was accepted after the Affordable Care Act was enacted. California and New York are the top states with the highest Medicaid expenditures. It is projected that Medicaid expenditure will continue to increase at both the state and federal levels.
