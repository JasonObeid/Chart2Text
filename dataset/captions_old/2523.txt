 The number of Facebook users in Australia had been increasing steadily throughout the years, with a forecast of approximately 11.5 million Australians having an account on the social media platform by the year 2022. This figure would represent more than 40 percent of the Australian population, making it the most used social media platform in the nation. Facebook - the most used social media platform Australia had one the highest active social media penetration rates globally, with most of the population having account on a social media platform. It is partially due to the country’s high internet penetration rate and heavy influence from the United States with regard to internet and social media trends. Furthermore, social networks were the most used platform of social media with instant messenger platforms such as WhatsApp and Facebook messenger coming in second place. Demographics of Facebook users Younger generations in Australia were much more active Facebook users with those between 18 to 29 years using the platform four times more per week than those over the age of 65. This was not to say that the elderly did not use Facebook but the data showed that those that do use social media platforms were most likely to have a Facebook account in comparison to other generations.
