 Dell’s market share of PC shipments worldwide remained above 16% for the entire year of 2019, making Dell the number three PC vendor in the world following Lenovo (25%) and Hewlett Packard (23%). Of the total global personal computer unit shipments of around 261 million in 2018, Dell was responsible for almost 44 million. Top vendors increase share in shrinking market Since reaching a high of more than 360 million units shipped in 2011, the PC market has declined every year since then and is forecast to decline even further. However, major vendors like Dell, Lenovo, and HP have managed to keep their unit sales steady and managed to increase their market share in this period of declining shipments. One reason for declining shipments was the shortage of Intel's central processing units (CPUs), which caused difficulties for vendors’ supply chains and inventories. The top three vendors succeeded in recovering by absorbing the costs by quickly switching to alternative component retailers, while smaller competitors have struggled. This enabled the leading vendors to stay competitive in terms of sales price amid these growing costs. Shifting to the cloud based world The market is also experiencing a long-term fundamental shift from on-premise hardware to cloud solutions. As a response, Dell Technologies has advanced efforts in cloud infrastructure solutions to simplify hybrid cloud settings through its company VMware, a cloud computing and software virtualization company currently worth 65 billion U.S. dollars.
