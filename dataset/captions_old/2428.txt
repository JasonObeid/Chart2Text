 An undisputable winner in a ranking of the most expensive keywords on the Google AdWords platform is ‘business services’ with a cost of 58.64 U.S. dollars per click. In second place was ‘bail bonds’, for which Google was earning just 16 cents less for clicks on searches for the keyword. CPC for the term ‘casino’ ranked third, with a cost of 55.48 U.S. dollars. The least expensive keywords in the ranking were ‘pest control’, ‘termite’ and ‘plumber’, all under 40 dollars per click. Is Google the king of search advertising? It certainly seems that way, as the search engine was estimated to bring in more than 85 billion U.S. dollars from search advertising in 2017, whilst Google’s Chinese equivalent and closest competitor, Baidu, generated search ad revenue eight times lower than that. Google has reigned over search advertising for longer than any of its competitors, with marketers investing the majority of their dollars in promoting products and services via either the display network or as text next to search engine results. However, nowadays, with the growing popularity of Amazon and their vast presence on the publishing scene, as well as Facebook’s enormous audience reach, Google’s kingdom is being challenged by the two platforms. What is more, the developing attraction towards using voice search among customers, and consequently among marketers who consider Amazon’s Alexa to have higher marketing value shows that Google needs to step up its game.
