 In 2019, a total of 786 movies were released in the United States and Canada, over 90 fewer than were released in the previous year. The biggest hit in 2019 was Marvel movie 'Avengers: Endgame', which outpaced James Cameron's 'Avatar' as the highest grossing film ever made with almost 2.8 billion U.S. dollars in global box office revenue. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has enjoyed impressive box office revenues in recent years with the success of 'Black Panther', 'Avengers: Infinity War', and 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' to name but a few. Whilst the number of movies released domestically in 2019 was much lower than in 2018, overall box office revenues for the year were relatively similar, although the figure dropped below 11 billion U.S. dollars for the first time since 2014.
