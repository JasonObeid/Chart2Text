 This statistic shows the leading 25 retailers selling baked products as the primary element of their food offering in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2016, ranked by number of outlets. In 2016, Subway ranked highest with 2,097 outlets in the UK, followed closely by Costa with 2,000 outlets. Similar trends are seen in the number of new outlets opened by leading bakery retailers in the past year. Specialized stores for the selling of bread and bakery products have remained fairly steady over the years, although there have been increases in production value for British manufacturers. While the bakery industry in the United Kingdom is predominantly industrial rather than artisanal, craft bakeries also play a role as artisanal products regain popularity.
