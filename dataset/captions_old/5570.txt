 In the European Union, the number of companies in the business of textile and clothing manufacturing has ebbed and flowed over the period of time between 2009 and 2018. In 2018, the total number of textile and clothing manufacturers was recorded as 171,072 in EU28 countries, marking a loss of about 17,000 of them since 2009. In contrast, the turnover figures of the industry demonstrated a consistently positive trend before peaking at 181 billion euros in 2017. More emphasis on clothing manufacturing The EU textile industry is segmented predominantly into two markets: textiles and clothing. Clothing has a clearly bigger presence with the number of enterprises devoted to this sector, almost double the number of companies that manufacture textiles. Likewise, investments going into different segments of the industry highlights the primacy of clothing to textile manufacturing in EU28. Industry employment declines Despite the rising turnover and EU investments in the manufacture of textiles, employment in this sector dropped significantly. While in 2009 over 2 million people were employed across all segments, in 2017 this number fell considerably.
