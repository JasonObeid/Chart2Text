 Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the enormous popularity of Marvel movies across the globe, ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ was the highest grossing movie in the world in 2018, reaching box office revenue of almost 2.05 billion U.S. dollars. ‘Black Panther’ followed with approximately 1.35 billion dollars in box office revenue, and ‘Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom’ ranked third. Fourth in the ranking was Brad Bird’s much anticipated ‘Incredibles 2’ with revenue of over 1.3 billion at the global box office, making the movie the most successful animated film on the list. The success of ‘Incredibles 2’ ‘Incredibles 2’ was one of the four films in 2018 to break the billion-dollar mark at the global box office, and holds the title of the highest grossing animated movie in North America between 1995 and 2019. With 608.58 million U.S. dollars in revenue, ‘Incredibles 2’ far outperformed a beloved 2016 movie ‘Finding Dory’, making over 120 million more at the North American box office. The release of the Pixar blockbuster was well-received by critics, as well as by fans who had been eagerly awaiting a sequel since ‘The Incredibles’ made waves in movie theaters across the world back in 2004. ‘Incredibles 2’ sold almost 68 million tickets in North America in 2018, more than double the amount sold for ‘Dr. Seuss’ The Grinch’ and well over three times the number of tickets sold for hit film ‘Ralph Breaks the Internet’. What do the highest grossing movies in the world have in common? As is rapidly becoming the norm, when it comes to box office revenue, movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe dominate the ranking. Among the 15 films ranked in terms of their global box office revenue, five are part of the MCU, and ‘Avengers: Infinity War’ made more than ‘Deadpool 2’, ‘Venom’ and ‘Ant-Man and the Wasp’ combined. ‘Black Panther’ superseded ‘Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom’ and all the MCU movies in the list generated well over 600 million U.S. dollars in box offices across the globe.
