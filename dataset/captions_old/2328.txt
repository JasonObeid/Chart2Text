 As of December 2019, the number of people employed worldwide by Puma was 14,332. The average number of employees across the year increased from 12,192 in 2018 to 13,348 in 2019. Growth in the workforce was mainly due to an expansion of the company’s retail stores, which included official Puma stores and factory outlets. Where does Puma rank in the sportswear market? Puma was the third-largest sportswear company worldwide as of 2019, but the company’s global revenue pales in comparison to its two bigger rivals: adidas and Nike. Fellow German brand adidas, the second-largest sportswear company in the world, generates almost five times more revenue than Puma. The disparity is further reflected in the number of employees at the leading sportswear companies in 2018: adidas employed around 57,000 people worldwide, while Nike employed approximately 73,000 people. Puma is clawing back share of footwear sales Puma has been making impressive gains in the footwear market over recent years. Revenue generated from global footwear sales amounted to around 2.6 billion euros in 2019, accounting for a 46 percent share of the company’s consolidated sales. Revenue from Puma’s footwear segment may have reached record levels in 2019, but the manufacturer’s figures are almost nine times smaller than the market leader Nike.
