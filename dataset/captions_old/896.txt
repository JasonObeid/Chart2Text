Cooking - additional information In the broadest sense, cooking is the process of preparing food for consumption, generally using heat. The act of cooking varies massively all over the world, from the ingredients available to the techniques used. Many people cook at an amateur level while some cook to earn a living. For most, cooking might just be a necessary part of survival, whereas others cook for enjoyment – globally 37 percent of women and 27 percent of men say that they are passionate about food and cooking.

Indian cuisine is very diverse, reflecting the vast array of ingredients, cultures and religions that determine the meals people eat in the country’s many regions. Outside of India, Indian “curry” has become hugely popular in western countries such as the UK and the U.S. While Indian cooking has often been adapted to suit western tastes in these countries, recent restaurant trends show that there is a demand for authentic ethnic cuisine. With the number of tourists traveling both in and out of India increasing, the popularity of Indian cuisine may be set to spread further around the world. Whether people cook for their hobby or simply out of necessity, many prefer to dine out and not cook at all. In the United States, people spend less than half the time cooking per week than those in India and in 2016 around 34 percent of U.S. consumers dined at a quick service restaurant, at at least once per week.
