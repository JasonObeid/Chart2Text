 Banks generally employ various strategies to attract and retain their customer base, such as cheap overdrafts, in-credit interest and no withdrawal charge. While the number of new and active customers can be easily observed, customer satisfaction is trickier. Knowing how customers feel about the service received can help banks adjust to the dynamics of an increasingly competitive market. Customer satisfaction for leading banks in the United Kingdom (UK) According to the Which? customer satisfaction survey, as of July 2019, approximately 86 percent of customers of Monzo Bank were satisfied with the banks' services and products, and willing to recommend it to their friends. First Direct and Nationwide completed the top three, with 85 percent and 79 percent customer satisfaction respectively. Investment in selected European countries Among the services that aim at making banking more customer-oriented and effortless is the current account switch service (CASS). CASS allows customers to change their bank account hassle-free, redirecting transactions and transferring payment arrangements. As of the first quarter of 2019, six out of 20 banks observed increased their customer base following the CASS process. The highest gain to loss ratio was recorded by Monzo Bank and Starling Bank, gaining respectively eight and seven times more new customers than the ones lost to other banks. This comes as no surprise, considering that challenger banks, also called disruptor banks, like Monzo have been gaining popularity in Europe in recent years. In 2019, Monzo was one of the top three online only banks in Europe by number of customers.
