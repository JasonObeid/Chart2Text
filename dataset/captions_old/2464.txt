Private label peanut butter came in second place in the same period. Peanut Butter Consumption It is estimated that around 297 million Americans eat peanut butter, while about 32 million do not. It is extremely popular in sandwiches, as a baking ingredient, or on its own. There are many different varieties of peanut butter available in the market but the two most common types are creamy and crunchy. Creamy peanut butter is the most popular among U.S. consumers, by a wide margin. Another popular type of peanut butter is old fashioned/natural peanut butter which is produced without any preservatives or ingredients to keep the peanuts and the oil from separating in the jar.
