 The above statistic shows the number of internet users in selected African countries as of June 2019. As of that month, Nigeria had 123.49 million internet users. Second-ranked Egypt had 49.23 million users. As of March 2019, the majority of web traffic in leading digital markets in Africa originated from mobile devices - in Nigeria, one of the countries with the biggest number of internet users worldwide, 74 percent of web traffic was generated via smartphones and only 24 percent via PC devices. This is connected to the fact that mobile connections are much cheaper and do not require the infrastructure that is needed for traditional desktop PCs with fixed-line internet connections.
