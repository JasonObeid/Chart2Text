Tijuana, Mexico ranked first on the list, with a murder rate of 138.26 per 100,000 inhabitants. Tijuana was followed by Acapulco, Mexico with murder rate of 110.5.

In the United States, St. Louis, Missouri ranked fifteenth with a murder rate of 60.59 in 2018, and was one of the few cities outside of Central or South America to make it into the top fifty. Detroit, with a murder rate of 38.78, came in at forty-sixth place. Violence in Central and South America is caused in great part by drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, and gang wars. Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador are major shipping points for South American cocaine, which travels through Mexico to reach American consumers. Between 2007 and 2012, it was estimated that there were nearly 38,000 drug-related fatalities in Mexico alone. Though rates of gang and drug-related activities in Mexico reportedly fell from 2007 to 2012 due to a government squeeze, traffickers have gone elsewhere and violence surged in other regions. Meanwhile, violence in Central and South America has influenced immigration from affected areas into the United States. Migration from Mexico to the U.S. was considered the largest migration flow in the world, with 11.6 million migrants in 2010.
