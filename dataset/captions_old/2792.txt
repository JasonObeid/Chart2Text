 Hewlett-Packard's revenue from printers and copiers reached about 20 billion U.S. dollars in the fiscal year 2019. The printing segment is one of two main business segments of HP Inc. Personal systems is HP Inc’s second business segment, which in 2019 generated around 38.7 billion U.S. dollars in revenue, bringing the company’s overall revenue to more than 58 billion U.S. dollars in that year. HP faces stagnant PC market HP Inc has so far been able to withstand the overall trend of a shrinking PC market, as the company has consistently shipped more than 50 million PCs annually over the past few years. Nevertheless, the company is adjusting to the changing market, for example by emphasizing the development of gaming computers, one segment that is bucking the overall PC market trend and growing. The company has also restructured its business model for selling devices. In 2017, HP Inc debuted its “device as a service” program so businesses could pay for technology and associated services and support on a monthly basis. Split of Hewlett-Packard In 2015 Hewlett Packard split up into two separate entities, with HP Inc continuing to sell PCs and printers. The second new entity Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) focuses on servers, storage, networking, and security services. Although Hewlett Packard’s leadership expected newly spun-off HP Enterprise to be the more promising half, HP Inc has gained strong momentum as an independent hardware company with its personal computer and printer divisions. As part of its push to remain a leader within the PC market, HP Inc acquired Samsung Electronics’ printer segment in 2017 for around one billion U.S. dollars, and in 2019 substantially expanded its business relationship with Xerox Corporation to meet a wider range of customer’s PC needs.
