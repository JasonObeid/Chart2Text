 In 2019, 135,500 people worked for Verizon as employees. The vast majority (just under 130 thousand) of Verizon’s employees are located in the United States. Workforce changes and future Even though Verizon is mostly active in the United States, the company provides products and services in more than 150 countries. About thirty percent of that international workforce was female in 2018. The number of employees has been decreasing recently; in 2018, the company stated that it would reduce its workforce in order to better position itself for future growth. According to Verizon, the reasons for the recent cutback include reducing costs (such as employee benefits- and pension plan contributions) and preparing for 5G technology. The largescale workforce reduction was achieved by offering employees who volunteered to leave compensation and other benefits. Verizon in the telco industry Verizon is one of the largest U.S. telecom companies, alongside AT&T. Each of the companies owns about a third of the wireless subscription market in the United States and they were both by far the most valuable telecom brands worldwide in 2019.
