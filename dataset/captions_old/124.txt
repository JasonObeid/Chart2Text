 The United Kingdom is home to some 32.5 million passenger cars. After slowly increasing over the past years, figures reached their peak in 2018, with UK roads busier than ever before. The only noticeable decline – apart from 2014 when the source changed – was seen in 2009 during the recession. The South East has the greatest motor vehicle density of any UK region. 5.21 million cars were licensed there by the end of 2018. Most common car models The Ford Fiesta is the most ubiquitous car model on British roads. By the end of 2018, there were some 1.5 million models of the U.S. produced car registered in the UK. The greatest number of cars in the country are small compact cars, like the Fiesta. The only SUV model among the first ten entries is Nissan Qashqai, which is manufactured at the Japanese company’s Sunderland, North East plant. Number of cars owned The majority of car owners in the UK have one car available to them. As of 2018, 53 percent of motorists had one vehicle in their household. Only one percent of respondents owned five cars or more.
