 In 2019, the crude birth rate in Sweden reached the lowest point in the last thirteen years when it was down to 11.1. The crude birth rate is defined as the number of live births in a given geographical area in a given time period, per thousand mid-year population. As with the birth rate in Sweden, the fertility rate has also been declining for many years, reaching the lowest value for a long period of years in 2019. More births than deaths, and more Immigration than emigration Even though the crude birth rate and the fertility rate in Sweden have been declining for years, the population in Sweden is still growing. This is partly due to fewer deaths than births, but also due to the positive migration flow of more immigrants coming into Sweden, than the number of Swedes emigrating. Babies born The number of babies that are born is decided by the number of women in reproductive age living in the country. As a result of an increasing population, in part due to migration, the number of babies that are born over time, remained close to constant in the last decade. In 2019, around 115 thousand babies were born in Sweden.
