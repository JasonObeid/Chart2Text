Makeup Brand Preferences The cosmetics market is more active and rapidly evolving than ever before, brands seem to be releasing new products with increasing frequency and new trends are sweeping the market on a regular basis.

American women between the ages of 18 and 34 years tend to prefer MAC, Bare Minerals, and Neutrogena foundations, while women aged 50 years and older have a strong preference for Clinique and Covergirl Clean foundations.
