 JD Sports Fashion, the UK’s leading sports and footwear brand, closed the financial year 2018/2019 with an increased number of retail stores through new acquisitions. As highlighted in this statistic, from February 2019, JD acted as parent company to 2,420 stores in total, including brands such as Perry Sport and Aktiesport in the Netherlands, Glue in Australia, and Hot-T in South Korea. With new retailers acquired worldwide, JD Sports expanded its retail space across its sports fashion and outdoors retail divisions in 2018. Growth outside the UK Not surprisingly, over the past three years, stores affiliated and owned by JD Sports in Europe and the rest of the world increased their contribution to the company’s overall revenue. Revenue in the European market now accounts for almost half the amount generated from UK-based JD Sports stores. Increasing revenue share from stores in Asia Pacific also proves the region to be a valuable trading location. JD Sports joins UK high street giants As a retailer specializing in sports fashion and outdoor goods, JD Sports competes with UK high street fixtures such as M&S, Debenhams, and Primark. Since 2008, JD Sports more than doubled its share of the apparel market and earned a place among the leading ten UK retailers in 2018. With more brand acquisitions on the horizon, JD Sports Fashion signals higher bids on the UK retail market.
