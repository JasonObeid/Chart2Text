 At 30 aircraft orders, Emirates was Boeing's largest customer in 2019. In November 2019, the airline updated its order book, made some contractual changes, and placed an order for 30 Dreamliners. Boeing reported 246 gross orders in 2019. Boeing in the international market Boeing and its main competitor Airbus dominate the global aircraft manufacturing market. Boeing is headquartered in the United States, and Airbus in the Netherlands, although the company's main offices are located in France and Spain. Boeing and Airbus are the aircraft manufacturers with the highest revenue globally. At the moment these two companies arguably constitute a duopoly. What is a duopoly? A duopoly is a market with only two firms. The lack of competition means that the firms can set prices based on the response of the other, which is higher than the consumers would prefer. The case of Boeing and Airbus is not a perfect duopoly because of the existence of other companies, but these companies have very low market share. However, aviation depends largely on technology. Any company that gets an edge in research and development has a distinct advantage in the growing world market, which means that the standard duopoly model may not fully apply here.
