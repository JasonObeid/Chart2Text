 In December 2019, more than a year after France’s victory in the FIFA World Cup, Thierry Henry was still the top goal scorer of the French national football team. Retired as a player since 2014, the former footballer of Monaco, Arsenal and Barcelona scored 51 goals with the French football squad. Henry, who won the World Cup with France in 1998, has been selected for international matches more than 120 times and is still considered as one of the most brilliant striker in the history of football, not only in France but in Europe. Olivier Giroud on the rise? The statistic shows that despite his ten-goal lead on the second of this ranking, Michel Platini, Thierry Henry might be passed at some point by Olivier Giroud. Giroud, who did not score any goals during the World Cup, was the only still active player in the ranking of the 10 top goal scorers of France’s national football team, alongside with Antoine Griezmann. With an impressive number of 39 goals scored as of December 2019, Olivier Giroud, third all-time French top goal scorer, for example scored more goals more than Luigi Riva the top goal scorer of Italy national football team. A team of champions The 2018 World Champions, led by manager Didier Deschamps since 2012, are now looking on the UEFA Euro 2020. France, who was one of the youngest teams of the tournament, was also the team with the highest market/transfer value. Players like Kylian Mbappé or Antoine Griezmann have now an estimated transfer value of respectively 186.5 and 164.5 million euros, making them two of the most expensive players in the world.
