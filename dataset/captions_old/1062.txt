Turkey's economy Based on economic standards, Turkey is recognized as an emerging market and is one of the world’s newly industrialized countries, having earned a place in the Group of Twenty, which is a group consisting of the twenty most important economies in the world. Turkey’s economical significance is partially attributed to the country’s growth, especially during the recent global financial recession. While countries around the world struggled to grow, let alone maintain a balanced economy, Turkey experienced a rather high percentage of gross domestic product growth annually. Additionally, Turkey’s financial sector saw significant improvements, most notably with the country’s inflation, which reached rates lower than those prior to the financial crash and even the lowest in a decade. With a rapidly growing populace as well as having had one of the fastest growing economies in Europe and the world, Turkey managed to maintain a stable and unchanged unemployment rate over the past decade, with the exception of 2009. However, despite a significant spike in unemployment, Turkey’s competent management helped bring the total unemployment rate to single digits for the first time in many years.
