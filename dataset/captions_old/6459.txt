 Despite the government's ban on Sunday trading, the situation of retail chains is not as dramatic as expected. In 2019, 242 retail chains were operating in Poland, the largest share of which belonged to the clothing and footwear, furniture, and food sectors. Retail sales in Poland Retail sales volume in Poland have fluctuated but remained at six percent since 2015. Growing incomes of Poles and social programs introduced by the government for Polish families are driving consumption. As a result, Poles are spending more and more money on shopping every year. In 2018, retail sales amounted to a record of 862 billion zloty. However, growing market demand increases the risk of product price growth. Inflation in Poland is expected to reach 2.5 percent in 2020, although financiers' calculations predict a much higher level of price growth. In December 2019, product prices rose by 3.4 percent year-on-year, with food and non-alcoholic beverages showing the most significant increases. Favorite retail stores of Poles According to profits generated in 2018, the largest retail chain in Poland is Jeronimo Martins, owner of the retail chain Biedronka. However, in the ranking of favorite stores, Biedronka occupies quite a distant position. It turns out that Poles appreciate shopping in the Rossman, Nike, or Lidl chains more, the latter of which is a direct competition for Biedronka.
