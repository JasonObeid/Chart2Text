 Over 20 million hectoliters of wine a year are consumed on average in Germany. Consumption levels have so far mostly been steady during the last decade. Meanwhile, per capita wine drinking has also remained largely unchanged during the same time. On average, Germans drink 20 liters of wine annually. White or red? White wine is more popular in Germany, judging by retail sales volume figures during recent years. In 2017, white wine covered more than half of the share of wines sold. Rosé and red wine sales have yet to pick up. Germany is recognized for its white wines in particular, the most famous example being Riesling. Besides this grape type, there are also other widely known ones such as Pinot Gris and Pinot Blanc, just to name a few. Not the biggest drinkers Compared to the United Kingdom and the United States, Germans generally drink wine less frequently. In fact, in the UK 15 percent of respondents to a survey on the topic stated they drank wine less than once a month, while the same was true for 27 percent of Germans. Europe’s biggest wine drinkers were actually the Vatican City and Andorra.
