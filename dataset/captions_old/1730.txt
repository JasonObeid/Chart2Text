 As of April 2019, it was estimated that MoviePass had just 225 thousand subscribers in the United States, a significant drop from the three million recorded in June 2018. MoviePass is no stranger to media attention, but after the recent claims from a source that they had obtained internal data about MoviePass’s floundering subscriber base, the company is once again in the spotlight. What is MoviePass? MoviePass is a subscription-based movie ticketing service, designed to allow subscribers to buy a select amount of movie tickets each month for a single fee. MoviePass has been controversial since its inception, with multiple app issues, price changes and major chains expressing concerns about MoviePass’s business model. Despite a sudden increase in its subscriber base in 2018, MoviePass has never been especially popular with potential customers. A study showed that most respondents had never subscribed to MoviePass and a large amount had never heard of the service. Among the few responding adults who did subscribe, most were under the age of 45, with only very small percentages of older generations saying that they had a subscription.
