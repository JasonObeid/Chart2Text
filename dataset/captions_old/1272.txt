 This statistic illustrates the market share of grocery stores in Ireland for the 12 weeks ending September 8, 2019. Dunnes held the highest market share at 22.2 percent, followed by SuperValu at 21.4 percent. The cost of food on the Irish market deflated amid lowering prices. As such, the consumer price index for food and non-alcoholic beverages is slightly decreasing. Such trends are seen in multiple food categories, further increasing the influence of discounters, such as Aldi and Lidl, on the Irish grocery retail market. Consumers predominantly shop in-store, although the share of consumers who have purchased food or groceries online had been growing slowly.
