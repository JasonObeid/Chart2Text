 Zalando’s active customer count has never been higher than it was in the second quarter of 2019. The Berlin-based online fashion retailer had 28.3 million customers who have placed an order through Zalando’s website in the last twelve months running up to June 30, 2019. Since the first quarter of the previous year, Zalando increased its base by adding over five million active customers. Heavy online traffic Similarly, average visits to Zalando’s website have shown a dramatic rise since the last quarter of 2018. While throughout most of 2018 Zalando’s website visitor numbers fared around 700 million, between September and December 2018, Zalando’s online traffic reached 960 million. This was only slightly lower in the following quarter, but still well over 900 million. Incremental revenue growth In the fashion segment, Zalando figures as the most popular online store among German consumers. In addition to the DACH region, Germany’s beloved e-retailer is also active in 17 different European countries. From these operations, Zalando generated ever-growing annual revenue since its foundation in 2008.
