The aging population The year 2035 is expected to be a turning point for the population of the United States. This is the year that demographers expect there to be more adults over the age of 65 than children. Additionally, in the year 2060, there are expected to be about 604,000 people aged 100 and over in the U.S. This figure was around 72,000 in 2015.
