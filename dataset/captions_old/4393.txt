 The largest geothermal plant in the world is called the Geysers Geothermal Complex, located in the United States, with a capacity of 1,517 megawatts. It is made up of 22 power plants and spread over several kilometers, located north of San Francisco. It sits on top of a deep magma chamber that spans over 30 square miles. The United States also has one of the highest installed capacities of geothermal power in the world. The thermal efficiency of geothermal plants is low due to the relatively low temperatures of geothermal fluids; however, its capacity factor tends to be high as it relies on a stable source of energy, unlike wind or solar. How does geothermal energy work? Geothermal energy taps into the thermal energy and radioactive decay leftover from the formation of the Earth. Geothermal plants generates energy by carrying heat to the surface via fluid circulation through various types of mechanics. The plants rely on steam generated from heated water and processed through several methods, including dry steam, flash steam, and binary cycle. Currently, Indonesia and the Philippines are in the process of developing some of the largest geothermal projects in the world. Asia has some of the largest geothermal resources in the world. These resource potentials are usually highest near geological fault lines.
