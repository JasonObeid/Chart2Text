 This statistic shows the population of the Netherlands in 2019, by age. On January 1, 2019 there were approximately 3.8 million people younger than 20 years living in the Netherlands. The largest age group was formed by those between 40 and 65 years old. Together, they number nearly six million people. The retired population of the Netherlands consists of approximately three million people. Considering this make-up of Dutch society, it is not surprising there are so many debates around increasing the retirement age. The ratio of the non-working population to the working population has decreased between 1950 and today, as this statistic shows. A recent forecast however indicates that this ratio might not decrease much further in the next 40 years, meaning the number of working people to support the non-working people will more or less remain stable.
