 The rise of digital and contactless payments in the United Kingdom and Europe has seen the need for physical cash machines fall in recent years. Between June and December of 2018, almost three thousand ATM’s closed in the UK. High street banking giants such as Natwest and Barclays closed over 200 each between December 2017 and December 2018. This decline is likely in response to the increase of cashless payments and the drop in withdrawals. Rise in cashless payments reflects drop in ATMs The UK has the highest number of cashless transactions of any EU member state. According to a 2018 payment methods report, cash is used in less than ten percent of transactions in the UK. The number of purchases using cash in the UK has been estimated to almost half by 2026.
