 Journalism may not be considered the most dangerous profession in the world, but with the number of journalists killed worldwide in 2018 amounting to a total of 80, the risks for those entering into certain segments of the industry are clear. After 64 journalists were killed in 1995, thankfully the number dropped sharply and remained below 40 until 2003, before increasing again to 88 four years later. Journalist killings remained above 50 for several years, but 2019 saw the lowest number of journalists killed since 2003. The countries where the most journalists were killed in 2019 were Syria and Mexico, with ten journalists killed in each. The perils of being a journalist: global insights In 2018, 251 journalists were imprisoned worldwide, the number of arrests made on journalists amounted to almost 350 and 60 journalists were kidnapped. Journalists have been captured and detained as punishment for criticizing a political regime or a religious ideology, persecuted for insulting those in positions of power, hunted down for images they published and shot dead simply because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. One of the riskiest countries for journalists is Mexico, where nine journalists were murdered in 2018. Journalists in Mexico are frequently placed under surveillance, threatened and fatally punished for attempting to expose or publicize political corruption, and despite the country being war-free, Mexico remains the deadliest country for journalists in the world.
