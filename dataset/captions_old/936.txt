 As of April 1, 2019 the basic annual salary for Members of Parliament in the United Kingdom was just over 79 thousand British pounds This marked an increase of just over 13.7 thousand pounds when compared with April 2012, when MPs earned 65.7 thousand a year. Comparison with average earnings In 2018 the median earnings for full-time workers was 29.57 thousand pounds a year, meaning MPs earned almost 50 thousand more than the average worker that year. Whether or not MPs deserve to earn almost three times that national average is up for debate, although it must be said this is not decided by MPs themselves. Since 2011 decisions regarding MPs pay and expenses lie with the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA). House of Commons demographics After the 2017 General Elections most MPs were aged between 40 and 59, with only fourteen of them in their twenties or younger. In terms of gender, there are almost two male MPs for every one woman, although this is a much better than in 1979 when only 3 percent of MPs were women.
