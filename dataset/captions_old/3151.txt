 The poverty rate in the Dominican Republic has been decreasing in the past few years. In 2016, approximately 5.9 percent of the Dominicans were living on less than 3.20 U.S. dollars per day, almost three-times lower than 2005, when 16.4 percent of the country's population was estimated to live in poverty.
