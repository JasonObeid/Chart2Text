 KPMG’s workforce broke the 200,000 barrier for the first time in 2018, reaching 207,050 employees worldwide. In 2019, the professional services company reported almost 220,000 employees, the highest ever. KPMG worldwide KPMG are one of the largest consultancy firms in the world, being one of the Big Four accounting consultancy firms. Their largest market is the EMA region (Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India), with over half their staff based there – although, the EMA region accounts for less than half their total revenue. The company is divided into main three service lines: advisory, audit and tax. Advisory, which includes consulting services for management, risk, deals and strategy, is the largest of the three services globally, although more revenue is generated from auditing services in North America and the Asia Pacific region. Accountancy consulting services While the Big Four accountancy firms – Deloitte, PWC, EY and KPMG – are by far the largest consultancy firms in terms of market share, this does not mean they dominate the industry. In a recent survey of the U.S. market consultancy market, none of the Big Four were named among the top three most prestigious consultancy firms for 2019. Instead, this honor went to McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting and Bain & Company.
