 This statistic shows the results of a survey about the penetration rate of several individual leisure activities in France in 2015, phrased with the question: "except reading books, which of the following leisure activities do you do in your free time?". It was found that listening to music was the most practiced leisure activity with a penetration rate of 88 percent of respondents, followed very closely by 82 percent of respondents who stated that they go out with friends in their free time with. Even though music is a very popular activity, it seems that French people would probably not choose to listen to music if they had more free time. Lack of time is one of the main obstacles to leisure activity. Alongside with listening to music, going out with friends was also a popular activity. The survey was carried out via computer-assisted telephone interviews, also known as CATI, and collected data from 1,000 respondents. Since the possibilities of chosen leisure activities obviously don't conflict with each other as they may be attended on different occasions, respondents were able to choose multiple answers resulting in a valuable ranking of leisure activities.
