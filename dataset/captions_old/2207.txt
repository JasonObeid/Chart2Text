 In an annual assessment of advertising campaigns, the top three spots were taken by promotional activities in India. The Womb Mumbai agency was responsible for creating and executing the most effective campaign for the product Carvaan – a digital music player designed to specifically reach older generations. The campaign was titled ‘Let’s make viral products instead!’ and by delivering meaningful and relevant messages was successful in increasing sales and net profit for the manufacturer. Best advertising campaigns – additional information The second and third spots were also awarded to campaigns touching on social issues. Both focused on matters of health and hygiene as they were indirectly promoting sanitizing products. Savlon sponsored soap-infused chalk, which was intended to encourage children in India to keep their hands clean. The campaign was created by Ogilvy Mumbai and upon being shown on national and international media reached roughly six million people. At the same time, McCann New Delhi was hired to develop an advertising campaign for a toilet disinfectant brand Harpic which would specifically target Indian families. The agency came up with an idea to draw attention to the lack of sufficient sanitary appliances in India’s households. Using classifieds and matrimonial ads, they managed to transform a simple fact of owning a toilet into a status symbol. As a result, the presence of a toilet in a home was a must before accepting a marriage proposal. That year more than five million new toilets were added to rural households in the country, in turn creating a larger market for Harpic. Both McCann and Ogilvy are in the top five of the most creative agency networks worldwide.
