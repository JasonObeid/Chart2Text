 This statistic shows the Retail Price Index (RPI) in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2000 to 2018. During this period, the RPI rose to 281.6 points. With the exception of 2009 - which the annual percentage change to RPI shows as a decrease - there was an increase in the index every year. The UK Retail Price Index of services shows that there was also steady growth throughout this period, although this trend was not mirrored by the UK Retail Price Index of goods whereby there was some initial fluctuation which was then followed by substantial annual increases. Fluctuation can also be found in monthly RPI, whereby RPI experienced a decline in each January, before gradually increasing throughout the remainder of the year. A very similar trend is found in the monthly Retail Price Index Jevons (RPIJ). In addition, an RPI inflation forecast is also accessible.
