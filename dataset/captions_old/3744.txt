 The highest rate of concussions among U.S. Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) members from 2010 to 2015 was among those aged 15-17 years. Among that age group the rate of concussion was 18.8 per 1,000 members. Unsurprisingly, the age group with the lowest rate of concussion was those aged less than 1 year. Many adults, especially those that are older, believe that concussions are a serious health concern. Concussions Concussions are considered a type of mild traumatic brain injury. Concussions are caused by some kind of trauma, hit, or bump to the head that causes the brain to move around rapidly inside of the skull. Concussions can have serious long-term side effects. Data suggests that males have a higher rate of concussions than females. Playing sports has a significant impact on someone’s risk of having a concussion. As much as 9 percent of youth in grades 9-12 who played sports had suffered a concussion in recent years. Traumatic Brain Injury Concussions are just one form of traumatic brain injury, though they are considered milder than other forms. Traumatic brain injuries can lead to death or permanent disability. The number of traumatic brain injuries seen in U.S. emergency departments exceeded 2.5 million in recent years. The death rate due to traumatic brain injuries is highest among cases where intentional self-harm is the primary cause, followed by cases in which unintentional falls were the primary cause of injury.
