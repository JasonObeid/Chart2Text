 This statistic shows the number of applicants to universities in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2010 to 2018. The number of applicants peaked in 2016. The lower figures in 2012 and 2013 may be connected to the rise of the tuition fee limit in 2012 to 9,000 British pounds per year. Nevertheless, the number of applicants per year increased overall during this period until 2018 when the number of applicants fell to approximately 634 thousand.
