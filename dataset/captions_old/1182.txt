Additional info: Assets An asset is an economic resource that can take a number of different forms. An asset is anything with economic value that an individual, organization or country is able to control in the expectation that it will provide future benefit. Tangible assets include anything that is physical, and can include vehicles, precious metals, currencies and real estate. Intangible assets are things that have no physical substance; this often makes the evaluation of their value difficult. They can include anything from goodwill to trade marks to patents. Where banking is concerned, assets come from a broad range of areas. Bank’s assets consist of various kinds of loans and marketable securities as well as base money reserves. Their assets are also tied up in physical properties such as buildings, equipment, and furniture. Unsurprisingly the bulk of a bank’s assets are financial claims on the property or the wealth of others.
