 First released at the start of 2017, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) was the most popular game on the PC gaming platform, Steam, during 2018. The battle royale game averaged almost 853 thousand players per hour, almost twice the figure of its closest competitor, DOTA 2. PUBG’s rise to the top PUBG also topped the Steam chart for the peak number of concurrent players on the online gaming platform in 2018. The game reached over 3.2 million concurrent players at its peak in 2018 – DOTA 2 came in second place with just under 845 thousand peak concurrent players. The popularity of PUBG can be seen in the fact that cumulative unit sales of the game reached 50 million in June 2018, just over a year after its original release. The game has been both a critical and commercial success – it scooped the Best Multiplayer Game award at The Game Awards in 2017 and has generated millions of U.S. dollars worldwide, achieving the most success in the United States. Steam undisputed number one When you think of PC gaming, you automatically think of Steam. The platform, developed by Valve Corporation, had humble beginnings as a digital distribution platform for Valve to provide updates for its games. Fast forward a few years and Steam released over 9,000 games in 2018 alone and is showing no signs of slowing down. In the same year, the peak concurrent player count on the platform topped 18 million for the first time, a significant increase from six million in 2012. It seems that while Sony and Microsoft battle it out for console supremacy, Steam remains the undisputed king of PC gaming.
