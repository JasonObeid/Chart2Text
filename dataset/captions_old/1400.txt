 While roughly 281 billion emails were sent and received each day in 2018, the figure is expected to increase to over 347 billion daily mails in 2022. E-Mail usage worldwide Despite the growth and prominence of mobile messengers and chat apps, e-mail has remained a central part of daily digital life. In 2023, the number of global e-mail users is set to grow to 4.4 billion users, up from 3.8 billion in 2018. In terms of the most popular e-mail clients, Apple and Google are in a constant battle for the top spot. In 2018, Gmail was the second-most popular e-mail client, accounting for 27 percent of e-mail opens, ranking behind the Apple iPhone e-mail client with 29 percent of e-mail opens. The prevalence of these two leading e-mail clients highlights the dominance of mobile when it comes to e-mail opens – mobile e-mail accounted for 43 percent of opens as of December 2018, whereas webmail accounted for 39 percent. This is not particularly surprising given that online usage has undergone a strong shift towards mobile in recent years. Gmail Launched in April 2004, Gmail is currently one of the most popular freemail services in the world. In October 2018, Google's e-mail service reported 1.5 billion active users worldwide. The Gmail app consistently ranks among the top ten smartphone apps in the United States, reaching over half of the mobile U.S. audience.
