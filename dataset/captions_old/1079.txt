 This statistic shows the real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate in Italy from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year. It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country. Real GDP is adjusted for price changes and is therefore regarded as a key indicator for economic growth. In 2018, Italy's real GDP increased by about 0.86 percent compared to the previous year. Italy's national debt Italy’s economy is a developed industrial economy that ranks as one of the largest in the world. A large and efficient economy has helped Italy attain a spot as a member of the G7 and G8, as well as the European Union. After the Second World War, Italy experienced a significant economic boost due to support from the ‘’Free World’’, which is a term used to identify non-communist countries during the Cold War. But several decades of economic growth came to an end after the 2008 recession; from roughly 2007 to 2011, the Italian’s encountered multiple setbacks that shrunk the national economy and dramatically affected the country as a whole. Debt became a major problem and Italy saw annual national debt growth primarily due to the country’s inability to maintain its budget properly as well as an overall decrease in GDP. As a result, investors often questioned the country’s ability to pay off its debts without incurring further debt, particularly due to the country’s large debt-to-GDP ratio, which remains one of the highest in the world.
