 In January 2020, the price for one barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil stood at some 57.52 U.S. dollars. WTI is also known as "Texas light sweet", and is a grade of crude oil often used as a benchmark for oil pricing. Price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, monthly WTI is also known as "Texas light sweet" and is a grade of crude oil. This crude oil has an API gravity of around 39.6 and specific gravity of about 0.827, which, relative to other crude oils is considered “light,” hence the name. WTI also contains about 0.24 percent sulfur, making it a “sweet” crude oil. WTI is often used as a benchmark for oil pricing, making the price of Texas light sweet economically significant. The price of WTI can be compared to the prices other of crude oils, i.e. UK Brent crude oil, the OPEC crude oil basket, and Dubai Fateh oil. Prices of WTI per barrel are on average lower than those of the two other crude oils, with the price of OPEC basket oil reaching 65.09 U.S. dollars per barrel in January 2020, and the UK Brent crude oil price at 63.82 U.S. dollars per barrel that month. WTI crude oil is also the underlying commodity of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s oil futures contracts. The recent price development of WTI crude oil relative to Brent crude oil has been influenced by variances in U.S. crude oil transportation and increased U.S. oil production per day. New transportation infrastructure became operational in the United States in early 2013, easing the movement of crude oil in the U.S. midcontinent and raising the price of WTI. Since then, U.S. refineries have increased production of crude oil to record levels, also raising the price of WTI. Meanwhile, expedited crude transport in the U.S. put downward pressure on Brent crude oil as domestic crude replaced some imported Brent crude. Between 2014 and 2016, UK Brent prices dropped rapidly, as was the case for all other crude oils.
