Heating oil basics Heating oil is a liquid petroleum product that is, among other things, used to heat residential buildings as a fuel oil in furnaces or boilers. Chemically, most heating oils are similar to motor diesel fuels and are often sold interchangeably. How is heating oil priced? Generally, heating oil prices are collected during the heating season between October and March. For residential customers, retail heating oil prices are determined by the cost of crude oil for refiners; cost to produce heating oil; and costs associated with marketing, distributing, and delivering. Consumers can lower heating oil bills by considering when they purchase, reducing consumption, and through government assistance programs.
