 This statistic shows the rising costs of EpiPens in the United States from November 2004 to May 2016. The cost of EpiPens increased from 106.32 U.S. dollars in November 2004 to 608.61 dollars in May 2016. In 2016, Mylan came under fire from the public and U.S. congress for the high cost of the EpiPen, which was estimated to cost Mylan only 35 dollars. As of August 2016, Mylan planned to launch a generic version of its own EpiPen that would cost around 300 dollars, or half the cost of the original.
