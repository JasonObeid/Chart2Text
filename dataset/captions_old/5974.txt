 Forecasts up until the year 2018 show that poultry meat consumption across the European Union is expected to increase to 11.86 million metric tons. In the following decade consumption will likely slow down, with the forecast up until 2028 remaining constant. By the end of the period in consideration, consumption will amount to an estimated 12.18 million metric tons. Poultry production in Europe The European Union is the third biggest broiler meat producer in the world, producing 12.5 million metric tons in 2019. Broiler meat refers to chickens that are bred for the sole purpose of meat production. In 2017 the United Kingdom and Turkey were the largest poultry producing countries throughout Europe, with 1.24 and 1.23 billion poultry slaughtered respectively. Reduction in meat consumption With the consumption of poultry set to slow down in the future, it is no surprise to see that 27 percent of Europeans are planning to eat less meat in the coming years, with five percent planning to eat no meat all. The biggest reason for this is the perceived negative health effects of meat consumption, followed by animal welfare concerns.
