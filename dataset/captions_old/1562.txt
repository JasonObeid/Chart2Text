 German vehicle manufacturer Volkswagen sold 14,687 cars in the United Kingdom in December 2019. Generally, sales figures were highest in March and September of each year, with September 2018 being a notable exception. The Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency issues new registration plates in September and March, which usually corresponds with an increased sales volume. The company’s UK market share in December 2019 amounted to 9.86 percent. Dieselgate In 2015, Volkswagen was caught deliberately cheating in emissions tests, by fitting their diesel cars with software designed to lower emissions levels in testing conditions, in order to meet respective air quality standards. Although they were not the only car maker exposed for such practices, as the first name connected with the scandal, Volkswagen became synonymous with “Dieselgate”. As of April 5, 2019, the European Commission has come to the preliminary conclusion that German carmakers Volkswagen, BMW and the Daimler AG had breached EU antitrust rules by colluding to mitigate competition on emissions technology. Volkswagen maintains UK market position Despite Volkswagen’s struggles, the company was able to maintain its market postion in the UK and also topped a list of largest automotive companies by revenue in 2017.
