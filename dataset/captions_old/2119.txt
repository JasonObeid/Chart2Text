 During 2018, the sales volume of ice cream manufactured in the UK amounted to approximately 328 million liters. From 2013 to 2014, sales fell by over a hundred million liters and have not recovered since. Before this decline, sales were rather stable at over 420 million liters. The wider UK market With the collapse in sales volume also came a collapse in sales value. While the sales value of ice cream in 2013 came to over 630 million British pounds, only a year later they amounted to 366 million pounds. Since 2014, the average expenditure on ice cream blocks or tubs has stagnated at 11 pence per person per week. The ice cream van has virtually vanished from British streets. The worldwide market Quickly summed up: the entire worldwide ice cream market is in decline. Goals of healthier – read sugar, fat, and dairy free – lifestyles have had a major impact on U.S. production and consumption. The same is true for the consumption in other markets in the world, such as Canada. The shift towards healthier eating is accompanied by a rising demand for products with a higher quality.
