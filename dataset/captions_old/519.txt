 In 2018, India had 483 million internet users. This figure is projected to grow to 666.4 million internet users in 2023. Despite the untapped potential, India already is the second-largest online market worldwide. The majority of India's internet users are mobile phone internet users, who take advantage of cheap alternatives to expensive landline connections that require desktop PCs and infrastructure. As of 2016, India had 320.57 million mobile phone internet users and forecasts estimate 492.68 million Indian mobile phone internet users by 2022.
