 California was the state with the highest resident population in the United States in 2019, with 39.51 million people. Wyoming had the lowest population with about 580,000 residents. Living the American Dream Ever since the opening of the West in the United States, California has represented the American Dream for both Americans and immigrants to the U.S. The warm weather, appeal of Hollywood and Silicon Valley, and cities that stick in the imagination such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, help to encourage people to move to California.
