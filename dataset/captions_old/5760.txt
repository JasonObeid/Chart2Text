 This statistic shows the total population of Eritrea from 2014 to 2024. All figures are estimates. In 2018, the total population of Eritrea was estimated to amount to approximately 6.05 million inhabitants. Decreasing population growth in Eritrea Eritrea is a small country located in East Africa, and like in many other African nations, its population is growing fast. In 2010, Eritrea had a population of 5.71 million inhabitants and the population is expected to increase to almost 8 million inhabitants by the end of this decade. The high fertility rate is the largest and biggest contributor to population growth in Eritrea, especially considering that the average life expectancy is quite low at around 64 years of age. The fertility rate has decreased somewhat since 2005, but it was still as high as 4.21 children per woman as of 2015. This reduction is likely not a result of socio-cultural-economic changes, but rather as a result of conflict; between 2004 and 2007, significant reductions to the annual population growth rate can be seen, which is likely because of emigration. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of Eritreans have fled the country due of poverty, the perceived threat of war and human rights abuse. As of 2015, more than 379,000 Eritrean citizens had fled their homes, and tensions with neighbor Ethiopia have been and continue to be high.
