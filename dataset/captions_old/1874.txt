 A July 2017 survey of U.S. adults found that approximately 13 percent of American men and seven percent of American women currently smoke marijuana. Impact of Legalizing Cannabis in the U.S. Since Washington and Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, several more states have followed suit. The tax revenue for medical and recreational cannabis in the United States amounted to 610 million U.S. dollars in 2017 and is expected to reach 1.8 billion U.S. dollars by 2020. The increase in marijuana production and retail also has the potential to create over 283 thousand jobs in the United States by 2020. Marijuana Consumption Methods Since legalization, there has been an explosion in the variety of marijuana consumption methods available. Though most marijuana consumers still seem to prefer flowers, or raw plant matter, 15.5 percent of the market is attributed to sales of edible cannabis products. In Colorado, volume sales of adult use marijuana-infused edibles were considerably higher during the summer months, at 918 thousand units in July 2017 alone.
