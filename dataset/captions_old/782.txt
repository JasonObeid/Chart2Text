 Quality of products is always an important factor when it comes to consumption and spending, and many consumers define a certain product’s quality standard by applying specific characteristics - one of those being its origin. Nowadays, Germany is synonymous with high-quality cars, for example, while Switzerland would be known for high-quality clocks or chocolate, and Italy for fine wine. Quality measured In order to make these preferences among consumers visible, the global Made-In-Country Index was conducted - to show how positively products "made in..." are perceived in various countries all over the world. The index is calculated based on each country's average weighted share of positive perception. First rank is set as Index 100. Quality perceived The “Made in” label was introduced in Great Britain in the 19th century to make distinguishing foreign products easier, since foreign manufacturers had taken to labelling their goods with false marks. Most of the products thusly labelled “made in” came from Germany, which is why the “Made in Germany” label gained publicity and became very well-known. While it was not necessarily a label of quality at the time, this perception has been reversed completely: “Made in Germany” is now one of the highest seals a product could receive.
