This is slightly ahead of the 83 percent achieved by VKontakte, and well ahead of any western social network operating in Russia.

VK has undergone significant growth over the past four years, with their user base rising from 39.7 million users in March 2014, to reach 81.1 million users by December 2017. VK’s presence is much smaller outside of Russia, however, with a market share of just 0.04 percent in the United Kingdom as of January 2019.

Indeed, Russians on Twitter make up the company’s tenth largest user group by nationality. 9.91 million Russians are using Twitter, compared with 14.1 million people using the service in the United Kingdom. 13 million Russians are users of Facebook.
