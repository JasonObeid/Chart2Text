 Switzerland has one of the highest natural gas prices in the world at about 73.5 U.S. dollars per megawatt hour in 2018; in comparison, the natural gas price in the United States was about 13.9 U.S. dollars per megawatt hour. Determining natural gas prices Like other commodities, natural gas prices are driven by supply and demand trends. It may also be dependent on the crude oil and petroleum markets. In the United States, natural gas prices were typically associated with oil prices, but the market has decoupled from oil markets in recent years. In the U.S., the natural gas market is split between the financial (futures) market, based on the NYMEX futures contract, and the physical market, based on the price paid for deliveries of natural gas. Natural gas demand Global primary energy demand from natural gas is highest in the United States and Europe. Globally, only a small portion of demand is for power generation, and is rather used by industry, buildings, and transport among other industries. The world’s largest natural gas consumers are the United States, Russia, and China.
