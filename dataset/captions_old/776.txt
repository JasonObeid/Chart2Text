 The statistic shows the U.S. total arms exports in 2018 expressed in TIV, by country. The TIV is based on the known unit production costs of a core set of weapons and is intended to represent the transfer of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer. The TIV is expressed here in million constant U.S. dollars as of 1990. In 2018, the U.S. arms exports to Saudi Arabia totaled to about 3,353 million constant (1990) U.S. dollars. The depicted value is only an indicator and does not correspond to the actual financial value of the transfers.
