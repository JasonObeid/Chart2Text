 This statistic shows the monthly amount of cars sold by Smart in the United Kingdom (UK) between July 2016 and December 2019. Peaks in registration numbers were recorded in March and September of each year, which was due to the issuing of license plates by the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in those months. In March 2019, around 1,000 new units had been sold.
