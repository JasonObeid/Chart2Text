 Canada’s carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel and cement production reached about 568 million metric tons in 2018, compared to 494 million metric tons in 1995. A large percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are derived from the production and consumption of energy. In Canada, energy-related emissions account for an even higher share of total emissions due to extreme temperatures, large land area, and dispersed populations. In terms of electricity, increased generation from renewable sources has also helped to decrease energy-related emissions, however, fossil fuels still constitute the majority of Canada’s primary energy supply. Which province is the largest GHG emitter? Alberta is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gas emissions in Canada. Together the top five provincial emitters, including Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia, accounted for over 91 percent of the country’s emissions. The oil production in Alberta contributes to the province’s high emissions, especially under periods of increased oil sands production. However, technological and efficiency improvements have helped reduce the oil sands emissions per barrel.
