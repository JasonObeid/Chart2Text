 On January 12, 2017, Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi released his Spanish-language music video “Despacito” featuring Daddy Yankee, and the rest is history. In August of the same year, the video became the most-viewed YouTube video of all time and as of December 2019, the video still holds the top spot with over 6.55 billion lifetime views on the video platform. Music videos on YouTube “Descpacito” might be the current record-holder in terms of total views, but Korean artist Psy’s “Gangnam Style” video remained on the top spot for longest (1,689 days or 4.6 years) before ceding its spot to its successor. With figures like these, it comes as little surprise that the majority of the most popular videos on YouTube are music videos. Since 2010, all the most-viewed videos on YouTube have been music videos, signifying the platform’s shift in focus from funny, viral videos to professionally produced content. As of 2019, about half of the U.S. population accessed YouTube for music consumption on a weekly basis. Popular video content on YouTube Music fans are also highly engaged audiences and it is not uncommon for music videos to garner significant amounts of traffic within the first 24 hours of release. Other popular types of videos that generate lots of views after their first release are movie trailers, especially superhero movies related to the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). The first official trailer for the upcoming film “Avengers: Endgame” generated 289 million views within the first 24 hours of release, making it the most viral movie trailer.
