 The average size of farms in the United States has seen a steady increase over the last decade. In 2018, the average farm size reached 443 acres, up from 418 acres in 2007. Between 2006 and 2007 there was a sudden drop in average farm size, but in recent years it has recovered and once again reached the same levels as its peak in 2006. Agriculture in the United States In 2018 there were about 2.03 million farms in the United States, down from 2.2 million in 2007. It appears that as average farm size has increased, the number of individual farms in the United States has decreased. Texas is home to the highest number of farms of any U.S. state, with 248,000 farms as of 2018. Major Crops in the United States The United States produces a wide variety of crops. Though the production volumes of some major crops, such as wheat, have fluctuated considerably since 2000, the production of vegetables for processing has been on the rise in recent years. Grapes, apples, and oranges are the most produced fruits in the United States, with the majority of grapes being grown in California.
