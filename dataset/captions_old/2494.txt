 This statistic displays the proportion of individuals who wear contact lenses only (excludes individuals who wear both contact lenses and eyeglasses) in selected European countries in 2017. In this year, Cyprus, Latvia and Slovakia had the highest proportion of individuals wearing contact lenses with approximately 15 percent doing so. This was followed by Austria and Denmark with 10 percent of the respective populations wearing contact lenses. Contact lenses come in a variety of styles and forms, such as daily disposables, weekly/bi-weekly, conventional soft or cosmetic contact lenses. In France, individuals are most likely to use weekly/bi-weekly contact lenses in order to correct their vision. Contact lenses are often worn as an alternative to eye glasses, or in combination with spectacles for functional purposes i.e. for sport. A survey was conducted in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2015 asking individuals what they wear contact lenses for. Of respondents, 63 percent said they wear them as 'every day wear', while 38 percent wear them for 'exercising or playing sport'. Out of 2,043 respondents surveyed, 89 percent said contact lenses were quite/very important for their day-to-day life.
