 In 2017, some 32 percent of respondents stated they will probably have sex on Valentine's Day that year, while almost half of all respondents stated they probably won’t. Is romance really dead? Valentine’s Day is generally considered the most romantic day of the year, which people use to give flowers and tokens of appreciation to loved ones. About half of the American population celebrate Valentine’s Day, but this fact does not infer that the same share of the population is taken or in love; in fact, a certain share of respondents rather bought Valentine's presents for their pets last year rather than a significant other, and another significant share of respondents spent the day alone, with colleagues, friends, or with family, rather than with a spouse or a partner. Romance is lucrative Although the enthusiasm for Valentine’s Day in the U.S. might be lacking, consumption and spending (806027) for this occasion is not: Valentine’s Day sales in the United States (285028) have steadily increased over the last decade, likely cracking the 20 billion dollar mark in 2019, with gifting experiences and events gaining in popularity (285034) – but staples like jewelry and flowers are still going strong.
