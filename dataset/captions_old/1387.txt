 This statistic presents the sales of the largest watch companies worldwide in 2012. In that year, the Swatch Group was the largest watch company in the world with sales amounting to approximately 6.96 million Swiss Francs. In 2015, Rolex was by far the most valuable Swiss watch brand. The overall brand value of Rolex was placed at 7.25 billion Swiss Francs in 2015, more than double the brand value of Omega at 3.5 billion Swiss Francs. The watch market has recently seen non-traditional watch manufacturers bring so-called 'smart watches' on to the market. As well as being able to perform normal chronometer functions, smart watches can perform functions such as schedule management, communication, connecting to the internet, heart rate monitoring and other fitness related functions. As shown by Apple's position on the list of top 10 watch brands among upper-income U.S teens in 2016, it is clear that this has had some effect on the shape of the market. While Rolex remains the top brand by a significant margin, Apple sit either equal to or ahead of brands such as Casio, Fossil and Nike.
