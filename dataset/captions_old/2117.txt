 Computer tomography (CT) scanners are vital medical technology used in the diagnosis and monitoring of various medical conditions. CT scanner utilize x-ray technology to make images of bones, vessels and other internal organs. As of 2017, Australia had the largest number of CT scanners per one million population with 64.35 scanners per million people. The country with the second most scanners at that time was Iceland with 44.33 scanners per million people. Diagnostic imaging Diagnostic imaging is a branch of medical technology that aims to use advanced technologies to create images of the human body for the purposes of diagnosing and monitoring medical conditions. There are several kinds of imaging available. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is another type of medical imaging common in developed countries. As of 2017 Germany and the U.S. had the largest number of MRI units per million population. Usage of medical imaging also varies significantly among countries with France and the U.S. having the greatest number of examinations by MRI in recent years. Medical technology market globally The medical technology market has been an ever-expanding industry. With segments in diagnostic imaging, cardiology and optometry there is ample opportunities for new technologies to be utilized. The top medical technology segment based on market share in 2017 was in vitro diagnostics, followed by cardiology and diagnostic imaging. Among medical technology companies Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson were the top two based on worldwide revenue in 2017.
