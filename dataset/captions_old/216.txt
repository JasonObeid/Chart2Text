 Canada’s appeal as an immigration destination has been increasing over the past two decades, with a total of 313,580 immigrating to the country in 2019. This figure is a decrease from 2016, when about 323,190 immigrants came to Canada, but is much more than the estimated 199,170 immigrants in 2003. Immigration to the Great White North Between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018, there were an estimated 132,417 immigrants to Ontario, making it the most popular immigration destination out of any province. While the number of immigrants has been increasing over the years, less than half of surveyed Canadians believed that there were too many immigrants in the country. This is most definitely a positive, since in 2017, the Canadian government announced its aim to significantly increase the number of permanent residents to Canada in order to combat an aging workforce and the decline of working-age adults.

The United States was the fifth most common origin country for foreign-born residents in Canada.
