 This statistic illustrates the market share of grocery stores in Spain for the 12 weeks to December 29, 2019. Mercadona holds the largest share of the grocery retail market with 24.7 percent, followed by Carrefour with 8.6 percent of the market. The Spanish grocery retail market, however, is highly fragmented, with a large number of smaller retailers. Although Mercadona has the largest share of the market, Carrefour has a higher value of net sales per store. On the back of the economic recession, discounters have grown in value and importance as Spanish consumers have had a smaller disposable income and reined in their spending. The economic situation as a whole has resulted in a decrease in the number of units of store-based grocery retailers. Mercadona: the indisputable leader in the supermarket scene The Spanish supermarket chain Mercadona saw a significant increase in its number of stores over the last few years. The chain grew from 1.3 thousand in 2010 to over 1.6 thousand shops in 2018, which represents an increase of more than three hundred stores during the period considered. The number of supermarkets in Spain increased in recent years and stood at over 22 thousand shops in 2017. The sales value of the Spanish supermarket chain has only increased in the past years, peaking in 2018 at approximately 22.26 billion euros. Shopping in Spain: trends and expenditure Spaniards did their home shopping mostly at supermarkets in 2018, with nearly half of the home food purchased through this distribution channel that year.

In terms of home shopping expenditure, the average person in Spain spent approximately 1.5 thousand euros yearly between 2007 and 2017, peaking in 2008 at nearly 1.6 thousand euros and featuring its lowest point in 2007 with an average expenditure of 1.4 thousand euros.
