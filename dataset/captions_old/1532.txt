 More than 86 percent of Mexican internet users surveyed in 2019 claimed they used Tinder for finding dates. Meanwhile, one out of four respondents cited Bumble and 12.3 percent of people surveyed mentioned Happn. Sex and solitude Approximately 42.7 percent of Mexicans who used dating apps stated in 2017 that they did so in order to find friends. Still nearly three out of ten people surveyed said they resorted to those apps to have sexual encounters, more than the 27.4 percent who claimed to focus on finding a partner. Around 27 percent of Mexicans who participated in another survey said they thought they would feel lonely most of the time throughout 2020. LGBTQ+ online Over 11 percent of internet users surveyed in Mexico stated that they used Grindr, a dating app focused on gay men. Homosexuality has been officially legalized in the country for nearly a century and a half. Now sex and gender-deviant people there surf the web more often. On average, lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgenders and other persons who do not identify as heterosexual and/or cisgender (LGBTQ+) in Mexico spent more time online than non-LGBTQ+ people as of June 2019.
