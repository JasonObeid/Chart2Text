 The number of liver transplants worldwide shows extreme regional variation. As of 2016, the Americas, Europe and Western Pacific had the largest number of liver transplants. The Americas, with the largest number, had about 11.3 thousand liver transplants in 2016. Organ donors Organs can be donated in two ways, upon a person’s death or from a living person in some circumstances. Among select OECD countries in 2017, Spain had the highest rate of deceased organ donors, followed by Portugal and the United States. Countries located in South East Asia had the largest percentage of living kidney donors, followed by the East Mediterranean. Likewise, for liver donations, countries in South East Asia had the highest percentage of living donors among all regions worldwide. Kidney transplants worldwide Among all types of transplants performed globally, kidney transplants represented a majority of all organ transplants. Much like the data indicated for liver transplants, kidney transplants also show distinct regional differences.
