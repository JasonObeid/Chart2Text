 First released at the start of 2017, PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) has quickly gained a legion of followers across the world, most notably in the United States. Almost one quarter of PUBG’s players base was in the United States, with a further 19 percent originating in China. The Battle Royale game, developed by Bluehole, pits up to 100 online players against each other in a fight to the death until only one player or one team is left standing. PUBG finds fans in the States PUBG has been a critical hit, having won the Best Multiplayer Game at The Game Awards in 2017 and gaining a further nomination for its mobile version a year later. This critical success has also translated to commercial success as the game generated almost six million dollars in the United States alone as of June 2018. In terms of unit sales, this amounted to 50 million units worldwide, very impressive considering the game was only released on Steam’s Early Access in late March 2017. King of the Steam games Although PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds is available across many platforms, including Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and mobile, it has found the most success amongst PC gamers. The game was originally only released on PC gaming platform, Steam, and this seems to be how most of its loyal fans play the game. In 2018, PUBG was the most played game on Steam in terms of the peak number of concurrent players – the game reached more than 3.2 million players in a single hour in its peak, far surpassing its closest rival, DOTA 2. Furthermore, the Battle Royale game also topped the charts according to the hourly average number of players – PUBG averaged over 852 thousand players in an hour while DOTA 2 in second place managed just under 455 thousand.
