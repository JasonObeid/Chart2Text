 There were over 10.3 million arrests for all offenses in the United States in 2018. This figure is a decrease from 1990 levels, when the number of arrests was over 14.1 million. Arrest rate in the U.S. Along with a high number of arrests, the arrest rate for all offenses in the United States was also high in 2017, with 3,152.6 arrests per 100,000 residents. However, this arrest rate is almost half that of its peak in 1996. Additionally, South Dakota had the highest arrest rate in the country in 2017, and Massachusetts had the lowest. High numbers of arrests and unsolved crimes A high number of arrests does not necessarily correlate to a high number of solved cases, and in the U.S., many cases remain unsolved. The crime clearance rate, or rate of closed cases, was less than half for violent crimes in U.S., and less than 20 percent for property crimes.
