 The District of Columbia had the highest robbery rate in the United States in 2017, with 343.8 robberies per 100,000 inhabitants. The lowest robbery rate in the country was found in Vermont, with 11.2 robbers per 100,000 inhabitants. Crime in the District of Columbia The violent crime rate in the District of Columbia was also the highest in the country in 2018, and there are a few reasons for this: Firstly, the population of the District of Columbia is quite low (causing a higher rate of crime), and secondly, issues such as the crack epidemic of the 1990s exacerbated the prevalence of crime in the District. As rising rents and gentrification force more people out of the District, crime is moving into neighboring Maryland and Virginia suburbs, as poorer residents seek more affordable living conditions. Crime in the United States Overall, violent crime in the United States and the District of Columbia today is far below the violent crime rate of the 1990s. While some may feel that crime is on the rise, due in part to media sensationalism, in fact the opposite is true, and the United States are becoming safer over time.
