 In 2019, the average annual premium of car insurance in Italy amounted to roughly 350 euros. There were however large regional differences. For example, residents of Campania paid on average 529 euros a year, well above the national average. Other regions where the insurance premiums were higher than the national average were Tuscany and Lazio. Premiums for motorcycles were roughly a hundred euros cheaper. Car theft rates in the Italian provinces One of the factors that affect car insurance rates is the risk of theft. Naples, the regional capital of Campania, ranked fifth for the car theft rate in 2018. The incidence of car theft was highest in southern Italian cities: all the cities in the top ten were located in the South. Furthermore, in this macro-region, one of the factors contributing to pricier car insurance premiums was the poor quality of the road network. Road accident rates Another factor Italian insurance companies take into consideration when setting their car insurance prices is the rate of traffic accidents. The number of car accidents with injuries in Italy decreased steadily over the past years. As of 2018, the regions with the highest rate of fatal car accidents among young drivers were Liguria and Sardinia.
