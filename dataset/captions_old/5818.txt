 In 2019, Boeing received gross orders for 69 units of its 737 narrow-body jet airliner series, but net orders after cancellations and changes (under the ASC 606 revenue recognition standard) came to a devastating negative 183 units. The slump in net orders came as a result of the jet maker's 737 MAX crisis. Boeing delivered some 18 units of its 737 aircraft to Delta Air Lines in 2019. Upon delivery of the last 737-900(ER), Delta announced in a statement that the company will cut ties with Boeing and switch to Airbus airplanes.
