 Reportable sales of Jack in the Box restaurants have been on downward trajectory in recent times, declining from almost 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in 2011 to around 336.81 million U.S. dollars in 2019.

Jack in the Box Jack in the Box is a quick service restaurant chain founded in 1951 in San Diego, where it is still headquartered today. As of 2019, there were just over 2,200 restaurants primarily located on the U.S. West Coast. The vast majority of these stores are franchised, with only 137 being company-owned. The number of company-owned stores has declined steadily from around 629 in 2011, accounting for the above decline in reportable sales.

In 2018 the initial investment costs for a Subway franchise were around 342,000 U.S. dollars – much less than the 2.2 million U.S. dollars needed to establish the second most common franchise, McDonalds.
