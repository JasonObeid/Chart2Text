 This statistic shows the trend-indicator-value (TIV) of the export of arms from Sweden in 2017, by country. The TIV is based on the known unit production costs of a core set of weapons and is intended to represent the transfer of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer. The TIV is expressed here in million constant U.S. dollars as of 1990. In 2018, arms export from Sweden to the United States amounted to 28 million constant (1990) U.S. dollars. The depicted export value is only an indicator and does not correspond to the actual financial value of the transfers.
