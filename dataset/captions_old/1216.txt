 Anheuser-Busch InBev was the leading beverage company in the world in 2018, with sales in excess of 54 billion U.S. dollars. The alcoholic beverage producer had a healthy lead in sales over the two following non-alcoholic heavyweights, Coca-Cola and Pepsico. Each had sales almost half that of AB InBev during that year. A history of mergers AB InBev was founded in 2008 through the acquisition of Anheuser-Busch by InBev (itself a product of merger between Interbrew and AmBev in 2004). In 2015, the company acquired SABMiller, further expanding its brand portfolio. AB InBev is the world’s largest brewer. In 2018, the company produced 567 million hectoliters of beer. Market dominanceAB-InBev’s size enables it to control a large portion of the American and global beer markets. Over 40 percent of the market in the United States is occupied by its brands. Similarly, over 30 percent of the global beer market comes from AB InBev products. In both cases, the company is the outsized market leader.
