 General Motors generated some 137 billion U.S. dollars in revenue during the 2019 fiscal year, a drop of 6.7 percent year-on-year. Revenue from GM's automotive segments contracted by eight percent overall and 16 percent in markets outside North America. Investments, unions, and weak demand in Asia Automotive revenue suffered due to various factors, including a labor union strike in the U.S., stalling vehicle sales, and high investments targeted at autonomous driving. Despite revenue of 100 million U.S. dollars, losses at GM's Cruise subsidiary soared to more than one billion U.S. dollars in 2019. As a result, GM's EBIT margin dropped 1.9 points to 6.1 percent. Chevrolet crossovers performed well but were not able to offset falling vehicle sales in the Asia-Pacific region: Wuling and Baojun sales fell from almost two million to around 1.6 million units. The manufacturer's overall vehicle sales declined by some eight percent, dropping to about 7.7 million vehicles in 2019.
