 In 2018, the estimated average inflation rate in Pakistan amounted to about 3.93 percent compared to the previous year, a slight drop from 2017, but an ever sharper one compared to four years earlier. Over the next few years, forecasts estimate it to level off at around 5 percent. Pakistan‘s more or less fragile economy Pakistan is one of the most populous countries in the worldwith a large Muslim population and a rather low urbanization rate, which means that the majority of Pakistanis live in rural areas. However, the majority of the country's GDP is generated by the services sector, which also employs most of the workforce. As of now, Pakistan’s economic growth seems stable, but that wasn’t always the case. Stable growth ahead? Like many others, Pakistan’s economy suffered during the 2009 financial crisis, and while it has recovered today, inflation was still over 10 percent in 2012. GDP slumped during that time as well, but now, ten years later, it has almost tripled and seems to be on an upward trend. Although its GDP generation now mainly relies on services, Pakistan still exports agricultural goods like cotton. However, the country still struggles with an increasing trade deficit and thus rising national debt – two factors that could hinder economic growth in the future.
