 In 2017 Dutch men, on average, had more sexual encounters via Tinder than women who used the dating app. According to numbers from a survey among heterosexual Tinder users, female users in the Netherlands found two sex partners via the app whilst their male counterparts found more than three. The source, however, does not provide a clear explanation why this is. It does refer to a larger development in the Netherlands, namely that singles, especially men between 18 and 39 years old, were more likely to use a dating app. Tinder is the most used online dating method among singles in the Netherlands There are no absolute numbers available in the Netherlands on how many people use online dating or which app or website they prefer for this. However, according to a 2018 panel survey, Tinder was used by 50 percent of singles in the Netherlands who were actively looking for a relationship on an online dating website or app. This was ahead of Badoo (25 percent) and the website Lexa.nl (18 percent). The Tinder app was downloaded more than 500,000 times on smartphones in the Netherlands in 2018. Unclear if Tinder leads to increase in number of sex partners in the Netherlands Roughly 25 percent of both male and female respondents in 2017 said they had between three to five sex partners in their lives. Whether online dating apps are directly adding to the number of sex partners, the survey does not mention. Instead, it mentions that apps, internet and social media “add opportunities” for sexual behavior. In 2018, for example, 34 percent of Dutch people aged 16 to 34 years said they had experience with sexting.
