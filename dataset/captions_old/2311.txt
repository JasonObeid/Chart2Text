 Mangos are native to South and Southeast Asia and are now enjoyed all over the world. The global production volume of mangos, mangosteens, and guavas reached 50.65 million metric tons in 2017, an increase from 46.5 million metric tons in the 2016. Mango production in Asia Much of the world’s mangos come from the Asia Pacific region, specifically India and China. In 2016, India’s mango, mangosteen and guava production volume amounted to 19.5 million tons, or just under half of the world’s mangos in that year. The volume of mangos produced in China in 2016 was about 4.8 million tons. U.S. Mango consumption Mangos are a popular and widely available fruit in the United States. The popularity of mangos among Americans is only increasing with time. In 2000, Americans on average would consume 1.75 pounds of fresh mango per year and by 2017, this figure had nearly doubled to 3.21 pounds of fresh mango per capita. Dried mango is another popular way to consume the fruit, and is readily available in many U.S. grocery stores.
