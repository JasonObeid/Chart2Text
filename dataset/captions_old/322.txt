 The size of the Bitcoin blockchain has experienced consistently high levels of growth since its creation, reaching approximately 242.39 gigabytes in size as of the end of September 2019. The bitcoin blockchain is a distributed database that contains a continuously-growing and tamper-evident list of all Bitcoin transactions and records since the date of its initial release in January of 2009. Cryptocurrency Bitcoin is the biggest name in cryptocurrency in terms of both price index and market capitalization. Given the growing public investment into crypto, Bitcoin and other established currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple, are facing increased competition from new, well-funded cryptocurrencies, which raised 4.1 billion U.S. dollars in total in initial coin offering (ICO) in June of 2018. Blockchain Blockchain technology’s unique ability to provide an open ledger for recording transactions while simultaneously ensuring security and verifiability lends itself to a variety of uses other than just cryptocurrency. Blockchain experts envision a huge amount of possible applications, with everything from supply chain management to online personal identification. Perhaps the most telling sign of the technology’s versatility is the fact that executives across industries are rushing to invest in blockchain solutions of their own.
