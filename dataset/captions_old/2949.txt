 In total there are about 61 active dentists per every 100,000 people living in the United States, though there is significant variability in the number of dentists available depending on the state. As of 2017, California, Texas and New York had the largest number of active dentists working. California was ranked first with over 30 thousand active dentists.

Recent estimates have suggested that the dentistry workforce in the U.S. is lacking by over 10,000 dentists. However, some states host a much higher number of dentists per population. The top states for the number of active dentists per population includes the District of Columbia, Massachusetts and Alaska.

While a majority of those that access dental services have some form of coverage to help them pay, a significant proportion of those accessing dental services are not covered by any type of insurance. Recommendations for increasing access to dental services include targeted public health programs, better insurance options and increasing the dental workforce within the U.S.
