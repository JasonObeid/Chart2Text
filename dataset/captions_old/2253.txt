Milan, the capital of Italian fashion, finance and commerce Milan, the capital of Lombardy and the second most populous city of the country is known worldwide as the Mecca of Italian fashion, finance and commerce. Recent reports show that the city generates ten percent of Italian gross domestic product and has the highest number of startups in the country. Every year Milan attracts more and more international tourists – in 2017 the city was visited by roughly 8.8 million individuals from all over the world, an increase of about 640 thousand in comparison with the previous year. Lombardy’s dream of autonomy This northern region, which is the engine of Italian economy, aspires to a greater independence from the central government and the status of “autonomous region”, nowadays enjoyed by five of the twenty Italian regions (Sardinia, Sicily, Aosta Valley, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-South Tyrol). On October 22, 2017 the inhabitants of Lombardy went to the polls to express their opinion in an autonomy referendum; over 95 percent of the citizens who took part in the voting declared to be in favor of a greater autonomy of the region, in terms of financial and managerial aspects, such as taxes, education and security. Despite the nonbinding character of the referendum, the results have given the local government a strong mandate to negotiate with Rome for more sovereignty for Lombardy.
