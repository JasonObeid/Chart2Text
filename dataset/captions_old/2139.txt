 This statistic displays the excise tax in euros per hectolitre of beer added to beer in selected European countries as of July 2017. Finland had the highest rate of excise tax valued at 153.84 euros per hectolitre of beer, followed by Ireland with excise tax valued at 108.24 euros. Excise tax rates vary across the European Union and often serve political, as well as financial ends, such as for environmental protection or public safety and health. Some countries impose further taxes at differing levels, as seen in Value Added Tax (VAT), resulting in highly variable retail prices of beer across European supermarkets. Consumption levels of beer, however, also vary between countries, as well as levels of imports. The United Kingdom, for instance, has not only one of the highest excise duty rates on beer, but in addition imports the most beer of all European countries.
