 In 2019, over 65 thousand Volvo cars were sold in Sweden. This was a decrease of more than four thousand vehicles when compared to the previous year, and the second time since 2012 that the company did not experience a rise in sales. Nevertheless, Volvo was actually the leading passenger car brand in Sweden that year, surpassing Volkswagen by more than 16 thousand sold passenger cars. A national and global success In Latin, Volvo means “I am rolling” - a word which perfectly describes the success of the company. Since the foundation of Volvo in Gothenburg in 1927, the company has continuously expanded its production to a range of different countries and continents, including Europe, China and the US. As of February 2019, Volvo AB and Volvo Car accounted for the highest turnovers of companies in Sweden, amounting to more than 500 million Swedish kronor altogether. Furthermore, Volvo is the fourth biggest employer in Sweden, employing roughly 100,000 persons. Conquering China As a consequence of the automotive industrial crisis from 2008 to 2019, Volvo Cars was sold to the Chinese Holding Group, Geely, in 2009. This was the first time in history that a Western car manufacture was owned by a Chinese company. So which changes might this takeover have for Volvo? While the revenue of Volvo passenger cars amounted to one billion U.S. dollars in China in 2014, sales are expected to exceed 11 billion U.S. dollars as of 2023. That is an impressive increase, since Volvo cars cost 99 percent more than an average car in China.
