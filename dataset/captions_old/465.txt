 As of the fourth quarter of 2019, Facebook had a combined 248 million monthly active users in the United States and Canada. Facebook user data – additional information Facebook’s data use policy or privacy policy as it is also known, highlights the company’s guidelines concerning user privacy, information and how they are likely to be used. It also highlights the difference between public and private data and the websites and third part apps which are integrated into its services. Federal agencies and governments have the right to request user data from Facebook. This issue was highlighted in late 2014, when Facebook came under attack from the British press for not releasing relevant information on the men responsible for the supposed pre planned murder on the British soldier Lee Rigby. In the first half of 2019, the number of user data requests issued to Facebook from the United States amounted to 50,741. This figure was higher than any other country. In comparison, officials in Germany only made 7,302 user data requests.
