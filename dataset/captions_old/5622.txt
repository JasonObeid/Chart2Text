 Southwest Airlines grew its available seat miles (ASMs) from 120.58 billion in 2011 to 157.25 billion in 2019. ASMs are calculated by the total number of seats multiplied by the total distance traveled. When describing the airline industry, people consider ASMs as a measure of capacity. Southwest’s fiscal status Accompanying Southwest Airlines’ increase ASMs, the air transportation firms’ revenue passenger miles increased through the last decade as well. During 2019, Southwest Airlines had an operating income of 2.96 billion U.S. dollars. For the same time period, operating expenses were around 19.5 billion U.S. dollars. In total, Southwest Airlines' assets rose to over 25.89 billion U.S. dollars in 2019. Strains on Southwest's capacity In 2019, aviation authorities around the world grounded the Boeing 737 MAX due to safety concerns following several highly publicized crashes (Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610). This ban seriously affected Southwest Airlines, which has a fleet of almost entirely Boeing 737 aircraft, some of which are the model under scrutiny. The airline was one of the top five buyers of Boeing aircraft in 2018.
