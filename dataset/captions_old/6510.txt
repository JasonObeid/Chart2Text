Compared to other European countries, Dutch consumers are less likely to buy online from foreign retailers. This might be caused by two reasons. First, the Bol.com brand (as well as the supermarket brand Albert Heijn, which have the same owner) is a household name in Dutch society and people are familiar with it. Another reason might be in the ease of use: like most Dutch online e-commerce retailers, Bol.com offers iDEAL (which allows Dutch shoppers to use their bank debit cards for online purchases) as a payment method.
