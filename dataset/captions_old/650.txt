 Between 2020 and 2021, the global container market is projected to increase by 4.8 percent. The global market volume reached some 146.4 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) in 2018. Uncertainty in the container market The Hanjin bankruptcy in combination with recent divestments, such as the sale of Maersk's energy unit, can be seen as indicative of the lack of certainty which is roiling the industry. In light of growing protectionism and political instability, the dynamics of world trade are beginning to affect the global supply chain. While it remains difficult to change the capacity of a vessel, ship scrappage levels remain high and demand for smaller vessels appears to be on the increase. The world’s leading container shippers include the Danish company APM-Maersk, the Swiss company Mediterranean Shg Co, COSCO of China, and the French company CMA CGM Group. APM-Maersk is the world’s leading container ship operator with a fleet of over 600 container ships. The port of Shanghai is the busiest container port in the world. In 2018, about 42 million twenty-foot equivalent units were handled here.
