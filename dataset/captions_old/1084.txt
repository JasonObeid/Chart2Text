 According to the latest available data, New Mexico was the state with the highest teenage pregnancy rate in the U.S., followed by Arkansas and Mississippi. Although New Mexico has the highest teen pregnancy rate, California is the state with the highest number of teenage pregnancies. In 2013, there were almost 57,000 teenage pregnancies in California. Teenage pregnancy Teenage pregnancy rates in the United States have decreased in recent years. In 2013, there were around 43 teenage pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15 to 19 years. This number was almost 118 per 1,000 women in the year 1990. It is believed that the causes of this decrease include more teens abstaining from sex and increased use of birth control among those teens who are sexually active. Contraception use The use of contraception among sexually active teens is vital in reducing the rates of teen pregnancy. However, in 2017, only 54 percent of sexually active teens reported they used a condom during their last sexual intercourse. Furthermore, only 35 percent of sexually active female high school students used a prescription contraceptive method during their last sexual intercourse. Access to contraception and taboos surrounding teen sexual activity remain barriers to contraceptive use among teens in many areas of the United States.
