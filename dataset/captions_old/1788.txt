 Under Armour is an American sporting goods manufacturer, based in Baltimore, Maryland. The company has experienced substantial growth over the past decade, with their global net revenues amounting to approximately 5.27 billion U.S. dollars in 2019. Under Armour had revenues of less than one billion U.S. dollars as recently as 2009. The majority of Under Armour’s sales come from apparel, with the remainder coming from footwear and sporting equipment and accessories. How does Under Armour compare to other companies within the sportswear and sporting goods industry? The global sportswear industry is a lucrative sector, which is forecast to continue to grow in the coming years. Nike and adidas are two of the world's leading athletic apparel companies and their brand values are on another level compared to Under Armour’s. While Under Armour is one of the largest sportswear and sporting goods manufacturers in the world, it is still far behind Nike and adidas who are the dominating companies within this industry. Under Armour has still quite a way to go before it reaches the same heights as Nike and adidas, however if the company maintains its strong levels of growth it may achieve this goal in the future. Puma is possibly a better benchmark of where Under Armour currently is within this industry.
