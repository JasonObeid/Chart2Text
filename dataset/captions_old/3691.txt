 2010, 2011 and 2016 saw the highest prevalence of asthma diagnoses in the U.S. in recent years. Asthma prevalence trends indicate a growth in the number of new diagnoses. Asthma medical care costs have also shown to be increasing in recent years. Without proper treatment, patients face higher medical costs and indirect costs of missed workdays and illness time. Asthma Asthma is a complicated chronic illness that affects a person’s ability to breathe. Symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing and coughing. Asthma is treatable through avoidance of triggers and through inhaled corticosteroids (an inhaler). Prescriptions of Albuterol, a commonly prescribed inhaler, have increased significantly in the U.S. Though, despite being used as a common treatment method for asthma, the out-of-pocket costs of albuterol have risen.Asthma prevalence Asthma prevalence in the U.S. is also increasing. Some U.S. states have seen a higher prevalence in recent years than others. Hawaii and Oregon have the current highest rates of asthma in the U.S. Despite having the highest prevalence rate, Hawaii does not have the most deaths from asthma. Recent studies indicate that New Mexico, followed by Mississippi, has the highest death rate from asthma in the U.S. Among all U.S. residents, the prevalence of active asthma attacks within the past 12 months has remained relatively stable in the last few years with some decline more recently.
