 From January to July of 2019, 54 murders were reportedly committed in Trinidad and Tobago's capital, Port of Spain. The number of homicides registered in this city remained relatively constant between 2016 and 2018, having decreased compared to the higher levels reported in 2014 and 2015. Still, the latest figures are not promising: the number of murders in the first half of 2019 already represents 82 percent of the number of people killed in 2018.
