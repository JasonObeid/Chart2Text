 In early 2018 the Labour Party was estimated to have over half a million members, by far the most of any political party in the United Kingdom. The next three largest parties in terms of members were the Conservatives, the Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats which all had membership numbers that numbered over 100 thousand. More members but less voters While the Labour Party clearly had more party members than the Conservative Party, it has also not been in power since 2010 and has struggled to oust successive Tory governments. In the 2017 General Election, despite achieving around 40 percent of the vote the Labour Party were still beaten by the Conservatives who had 42.2 percent of the vote and won an additional 56 seats. Could Labour win power in 2019? In the event of a general election in 2019 it is unclear who would come out on top. Current polls suggest that both the Labour and Conservative’s have lost significant levels of support, with 24 percent of adults advising they would vote for the Conservative Party, compared with only 18 percent of people who said they would vote for the Labour Party as of July 2019.
