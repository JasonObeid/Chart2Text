 Facebook is the biggest social network worldwide, and its accessibility through multiple mobile apps as well as its mobile website plays a large part in its success. In January 2020, 98 percent of active user accounts worldwide accessed the social network via any kind of mobile phone. Facebook in mobile-first markets The countries with the biggest Facebook audiences are India, the United States, Brazil and Indonesia, all of which have more than 100 million Facebook users each. With the exception of the United States, all of these are digital markets with mobile-first audiences. In many emerging markets, mobile is often the first online experience, providing online users with their first internet experience through inexpensive smartphones and mobile data contracts. In India and Indonesia, mobile by far surpasses desktop in terms of audiences and time spent. Mobile Facebook access Due to the social network’s wide reach on mobile, it is unsurprising that Facebook consistently ranks as one of the most-downloaded app publishers worldwide. The company usually racks up more than 100 million total app downloads on a monthly basis. Some of the apps published by Facebook include the eponymous social networking app (and its low-bandwidth version, Facebook Lite), Facebook Messenger (also available as Messenger Lite), Facebook Pages Manager and Facebook Local. In the Google Play Store, Facebook Messenger, Messenger Lite and Facebook frequently rank among the top downloaded apps every month.
