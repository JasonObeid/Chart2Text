 More people are using Facebook in Europe than ever before, with the company recording 385 million monthly active users (MAUs) in the second quarter of 2019. That represents a growth of six million active users from the previous quarter, and 121 million users from the fourth quarter of 2012. It also marks the third consecutive period of growth, after the company lost millions of MAU at the same time news of the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke. Monthly active users worldwide In the fourth quarter of 2008 Facebook provided a service for just 100 million active users. As of the fourth quarter of 2013, that number had risen to an astounding 2.32 billion MAUs. The number of MAUs has never taken a backward step during that time. Growth outside of Europe and North America Facebook continues to focus on regions outside of Europe and North America, and the reward of this effort can be seen in areas such as the Asia Pacific Region, where the company has seen significant gains in terms of growing the active user base. Facebook just broke the 600 million daily active user (DAU) barrier in the first quarter of 2019, an improvement on the quarter before.
