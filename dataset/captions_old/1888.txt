 This statistic depicts the revenue of the leading 25 apparel suppliers in North America in 2014. In that year, alphabroder (Ash City) was the leading apparel supplier in the North America with a revenue that amounted to about 815 million U.S. dollars. The apparel manufacturing industry in the United States employed about 87,242 people in 2015; which in retrospect seems quite minuscule for being the largest global apparel market. However, one must remember that even though the majority of these apparel conglomerates are American based, many of them have their manufacturing plants in Asia. In 2015, the United States imported close to 88 billion U.S. dollars worth of apparel.
