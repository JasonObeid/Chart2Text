 Between 2008 and 2018, the annual volume of concentrated milk produced in the Netherlands increased, from roughly 342 million kilograms to 344 million kilograms. Production peaked in 2015, when the country produced nearly 408 million kilograms of concentrated or thickened milk. This specific type of milk is obtained by removing a part of the water, resulting in a thick milk which can be used to add to coffee or tea. The production in the Netherlands in this period was considerably higher than, for example, the production of concentrated milk in France Trade in concentrated milk A large share of the concentrated milk produced in the Netherlands is exported to other countries. In the last decade, concentrated milk exports grew considerably, reaching a value of just over 475 million euros in 2017. That year, the import value of concentrated milk and cream was just a fraction of the export value, at roughly 126 million euros. By comparison, the export value of non-concentrated milk in the same period was nearly 841 million euros. Supplying dairy to the world In 2017, dairy exports from the Netherlands amounted to just over 7.8 billion euros. The majority of the Dutch dairy exported was destined for other European countries. After Europe, the most important export markets were Asia and Africa. As the Netherlands exports far more dairy products than it imports, the country had a positive trade balance of 4.2 billion euros that year.
