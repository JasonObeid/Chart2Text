Currently, Riley P. Bechtel functions as the company’s chief executive officer, a position he took over from his father Stephen D. Bechtel in 1990. As a result of poor management decisions made by Riley P. Bechtel during the late 1990s and early 2000s, the firm struggled financially, but recovered. The construction and engineering giant operates through five global business units and is predominantly active in the energy and power sector, the environmental sector, the government services sector, the civil infrastructure sector and the industrial sector. The most important projects carried out by Bechtel include the building of Hoover Dam, Hong Kong International Airport, King Fahd International Airport, the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system and Ivanpah Solar Electric Power Facility, which is a solar thermal power project located in the Mojave Desert.
