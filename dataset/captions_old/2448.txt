 The number of hospitals in Germany has been decreasing every year, amounting to 1,942 in 2017. In comparison, there were 2,242 hospitals in 2000. The number of hospital beds has been dropping also, from 571,600 in 2000 to 497,200 recorded in 2017. Hospital reform While there can be many reasons for a hospital closing, in Germany most of them have to do with the so-called ongoing hospital reform (Krankenhausreform) or the hospital structure law (Krankenhausstrukturgesetz). A summary of explanations from the government involves falling rural inhabitant numbers, which may lead to rural hospitals closing, and an aging population in general, therefore making it a necessity to check hospitals for being up-to-date in terms of equipment, staff and availability. Future remains to be seen On a positive note, statutory health insurance spending on hospital treatments in Germany has been increasing during the last decade, covering almost 75 million euros in 2017. The long-term effects of the hospital reform remain to be seen, as opening a new hospital after a closing, deciding on locations in rural areas, refurbishing working hospitals and hiring staff takes time and resources.
