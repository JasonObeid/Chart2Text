 Electricity prices for households in Italy saw an overall increase during this period, rising from 19.65 euro cents per kilowatt-hour to 23.01 euro cents. Between 2010 and 2015, there was a gradual increase in cost, peaking at 24.5 euro cents per kilowatt-hour. The following years experienced a steady decline, falling to 20.67 euro cents by the first half of 2018 before starting to rise again. High electricity prices The prices the average customer in Italy paid for electricity saw a lot of variation per quarter between 2014 and 2018. Despite seeing a decrease of approximately eight percent in the second quarter of 2018, the following quarters saw consecutive increases, with prices rising by almost eight percent at the end of the year. As of 2018, Italy paid some of the highest prices for electricity in the world. Pricing factors Factors such as the fuel used to generate energy plays a role in the prices paid for electricity. The country is mainly reliant on natural gas for its energy mix and it made up 45 percent of the total in 2017. Despite a reliance on gas, Italy produces very little natural gas itself and is dependent on imports. In fact, Italy is the second largest natural gas importer in Europe. The main natural gas exporters to Italy were Russia and Algeria in 2017.
