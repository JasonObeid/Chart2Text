It describes the value of brands based on the assumption that the owner of a well-known brand name can generate more money compared to products with a less well-known name. Nation brand value When it comes to nation brand value, the United States was the leading country by some distance in 2018, valued at more than double the nation brand value of second placed China. Nation brand value refers to the impact of a country’s national image on a country’s economy and the brands based in the country.
