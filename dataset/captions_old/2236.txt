 Delta Air Lines' load factor of 86.3 percent in 2019 represents a slight increase from last year's 85.5 percent. The passenger load factor of U.S. airlines was 83.72 percent in 2018, making Delta above the average. Delta's load factor Passenger load factor is a measure of utilized available seating capacity calculated by dividing revenue passenger miles by available seat miles for a reporting period. Such a high load factor is a testament to the carrier's operational achievement, meaning that a large majority of Delta's flights operated at near capacity. From an economic standpoint, Delta's finances are positively influenced by this high load factor, as more passengers means more revenue. Delta’s passenger satisfaction A delicate tension for airlines is increasing efficiency, thereby raising passenger load, without giving passengers an overly crowded flight experience resulting in negative opinions of an airline. Delta seems to balance this well, as the company held a low rate of consumer complaints in 2018. The company had over 192 million passengers in 2018 and has the highest market value of publicly held airline companies worldwide as of 2019.
