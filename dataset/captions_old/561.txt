 This statistic presents the most retweeted Twitter posts of all time. The most re-tweeted tweet of all time was posted by Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa on January 5, 2019. The entrepreneur offered one million yen each to 100 randomly selected people who retweeted the message and followed his account. Until January 2019, the first spot on the ranking was claimed by Carter Wilkerson, asking fast food chain Wendy's for free chicken nuggets in exchange for retweets. A star-studded selfie taken by Ellen DeGeneres during the 2014 Academy Awards ceremony still remains one of the most popular posts on Twitter with more than 3.2 million retweets, still ranking in third place after leading the ranking for many years.
