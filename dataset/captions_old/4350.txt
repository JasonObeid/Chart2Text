 The ‘merging of two companies into one, or the ‘buying’ of one company by another through acquisition is a common practice in the corporate world. M&A can be used to fulfill several strategies including growth, expansion, increasing market share, eliminating a competitor or even talent acquisition. For both the buyer and seller, strategic drivers differ. M&A in Europe Inbound and outbound M&A, otherwise known as cross-border M&A is a deal between two companies that do not have headquarters residing in the same country. The largest merger and acquisition deal ever was the cross-border acquisition of the German company Mannesmann AG by British firm Vodafone AirTouch PLC in 1999. Cross-border on the rise Between 2010 and 2018, cross-border acquisitions have accounted for just over a quarter of all deals made, and a further 37 percent of the total deal value. Regions such as Europe and South America rely on cross-border activity far more than others such as the United States and China.
