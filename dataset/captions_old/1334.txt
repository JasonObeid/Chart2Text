 As recorded by the Spanish Statistics Institute (INE), Moroccans ranked first as the foreign nationality with more residents in Spain in 2017, closely followed by Colombians and Venezuelans. After years of losing its foreign population, Spain’s immigration figures started to pick up in 2015, with the number of people that moved to the Mediterranean country surpassing the number of foreigners that decided to leave. The depopulation of a country Even though Spain is continually losing its nationals, the inflow migration figures of the European country saw an enormous increase over the last few years, ceasing the country’s ongoing downward trend in population in 2016. The population of Spain has been in decline for many years and was projected to decrease by nearly one million by 2023. This will not come as a surprise since Spain has the lowest fertility rate in the European Union, with barely 1.34 children per woman according to the latest reports. The European Union immigration context In 2015, the European Union confronted a rising number of refugees arriving from the Middle East. Consequently, migration figures show that Germany accommodated approximately 14 million foreign-born citizens, ranking it as the country that most hosted immigrants in Europe in 2018. By comparison, Spain’s foreign population stood merely over six million, positioning the Western Mediterranean country sixth on the European list of foreign-born population.
