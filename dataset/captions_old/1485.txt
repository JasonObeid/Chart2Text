 The leading countries for installed renewable energy in 2018 were China, the U.S., and Brazil. China was leading in renewable energy installations with a capacity of around 696 gigawatts. The U.S., in second place, had a capacity of around 245 gigawatts. Renewable energy is an important step in mitigating climate change and reducing the consequences caused by the phenomenon. Renewable Energy Capacity Renewable power capacity is defined as the maximum generating capacity of installations that use renewable sources to generate electricity. Recent data suggests that renewable energy as a share of the world’s power production is increasing. Renewable energy consumption varies from country to country. The top countries for renewable energy consumption are China, United States, and Germany, respectively. Types of Renewable Energy There are various types of renewable energy sources used globally including, bioenergy, solar energy, hydropower, and geothermal energy, to name a few. Globally, China and Canada are the top two countries in terms of generating the most energy through hydropower. Geothermal energy has been on the rise as well. Data shows an increase in geothermal energy capacity globally in the last 10 years . Likewise, there has been a dramatic increase in the capacity of global solar energy in recent years.
