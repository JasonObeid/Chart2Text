 This statistic displays the annual exchange rate (average or standardized measure) of the euro to the Indian rupee (EUR INR), according to data from the European Central Bank, from the early days of the euro in 2001 up until 2019. The average, or standardized, measure shows the calculation based on many observations throughout the period in question, which is different than an annual measure at point in time: this denotes concrete values as of the end of the year. Between the years of 2001 and 2014, the average annual exchange rate of the euro to the Indian rupee noted an overall increase. In 2014, the euro to Indian rupee annual average exchange rate was equal to 81.04, which meant that one euro could buy 81.04 Indian rupees. By 2019, this value had fluctuated, to a value of 78.84, which meant that one euro could buy 78.84 Indian rupees.
