 Royal Dutch Shell’s number of shares amounted to nearly 8.3 billion in 2018. This is a large increase from the number of shares available in 2008; which equaled about 6.2 billion shares.

Royal Dutch Shell Company Overview Royal Dutch Shell, also known as Shell, is a group of chemical and petrochemical companies. Their businesses deal with the extraction of crude oil and natural gas as well as the refining and production of oils and gasses. While Shell’s revenue has been variable over the years, in recent years there has been a significant increase in revenue for the company. As of 2018 the largest share of Shell’s revenue came from Asia, Oceania and Africa, followed by Europe. Shell’s Environmental Impact Shell, like many oil companies, does not have a clean track record when it comes to oil spills and environmental impact. In 2008 Shell was responsible for an oil spill in the Niger delta that affected over 69,000 people and horribly damaged the natural landscape and wildlife. The company has made efforts to reduce their environmental impact in some ways. Since the 2008 oil spill Shell has decreased the amount of oil released in operational spills, limiting their environmental impact. Likewise, the direct greenhouse gas emissions made by Shell have decreased over time. Additionally, the company’s global production of waste has also begun to decrease in recent years.
