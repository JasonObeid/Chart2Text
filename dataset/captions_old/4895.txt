 The New York Times Media Group's circulation revenue amounted to 275.28 million U.S. dollars in the final quarter of 2019, up from 263.5 million in the corresponding quarter of 2018.

However, for the most part, the company sees a small revenue decrease in the third quarter, which has been an ongoing and consistent trend for the company over the last few years.
