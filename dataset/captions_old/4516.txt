 This statistic shows average ad spending by small businesses in the United Kingdom in 2011 and 2013. In 2013, spending reached 3,029 British pounds. Advertising spending grew by more than half during the period in consideration. Television is still a key source for all advertising spend in the United Kingdom and has seen significant growth since 1999. In 2017 the net advertising spend for television was 4.4 billion British pounds, an addition of nearly 1 billion British pounds since 1999. In an ever growing world of technology, it is no surprise to see that paid search has seen substantial growth. With more and more consumers owning a mobile phone and laptop, as well as people who have access to the internet nearly all day long, advertising spend for paid search has sky rocketed. In 2005 the first year that was recorded for this type of advertising, the net advertising spend was 768 million British pounds. This number has since grown to 6.15 billion British pounds in 2015, an increase of nearly 800 percent.
