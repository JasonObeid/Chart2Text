 The combined operating revenue of U.S. airlines has increased each year since 2015, reaching an all-time high of just under 239.7 billion U.S. dollars in 2018. Revenue streams Operating revenue is the revenue generated by a company from its primary business activities. In the case of most airlines, we can divide operating revenue into four main types: airfares, ancillary, cargo and other. Airfares is simply the revenue generated from the sale of flights, while cargo is any additional revenue generated from transporting freight or mail in addition to passengers. Ancillary airlines are the additional fees that are sometimes charged to passengers for extra services such as seat allocation, additional baggage, meals and access to an in-flight entertainment system or in-flight Wi-Fi. Ancillary revenue can comprise a significant portion of an airline’s total revenue, especially for low-cost carriers. Finally, other includes revenue from regular non-flight services such as frequent flyer programs or consumer credit cards offered by the airline. U.S. airlines In 2018, the largest four passenger airlines in the U.S. accounted for just under two thirds of the total operating revenue generated by U.S. airlines. The three large full-service network carriers – American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United – all reported a similar operating revenues in 2018 of between 40 and 45 billion U.S. dollars. Southwest Airlines – the fourth-largest U.S. airline and largest U.S. low-cost carrier – generated operating revenues around half that of the large network carriers.
