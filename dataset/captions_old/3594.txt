 According to the most recent data, more people died in Spain than were born in 2018, with figures reaching over 427 thousand deaths versus 370 thousand newborns. During the period under consideration, 2008 ranked as the year in which the largest number of children were born, with figures reaching over half million newborns. The depopulation of a country The population of Spain has been in decline for many years and was projected to decrease by nearly one million by 2023. This will not come as a surprise since Spain has the lowest fertility rate in the European Union, with barely 1.34 children per woman according to the latest reports. During the last ten years, the country featured a continuous population density of approximately 93 inhabitants per square kilometer – a figure far from the European average, which stood nearly at nearly 121 inhabitants per square kilometer in 2017. Migration inflow: an essential role in the Spanish population growth One of the key points to balance out this population downtrend in Spain is immigration – Spain’s immigration figures finally started to pick up in 2015 after a downward trend that presumably initiated after the 2008 financial crisis, which left Spain with one of the highest unemployment rates in Europe.
