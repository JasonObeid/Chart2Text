 In 2017, Amazon's market share of the U.S. e-commerce retail market was 37 percent, and this is expected to increase significantly by 2021. As of the date of survey it has been projected that Amazon's market share will account for 50 percent of the entire e-commerce retail market's gross merchandise volume (GMV). Amazon’s e-commerce dominance Amazon is the leading online retailer in the United States, offering a wide range of shopping products and services to its customer base. One of the company’s not-so-secret-weapons to increase customer spending is Amazon Prime, a subscription membership that includes free and faster shipping options as well as streaming music and video. As of December 2018, 62 percent of Amazon’s customers in the United States were Amazon Prime members. This is relevant to Amazon’s success as a company, as Prime members are highly engaged shoppers who spend more than double the amount of non-Prime members on the platform per year. The most popular shopping categories of Amazon Prime members are electronics, apparel and home and kitchen items. Amazon Prime Day In 2015, Amazon launched its one-day members-only shopping event Prime Day, ostensibly to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Amazon's founding. However, this Prime-exclusive event has turned into one of the company’s biggest shopping days, rivaling traditional holiday shopping juggernauts Black Friday and Cyber Monday in terms of sales. In 2018, Amazon Prime Day sales amounted to 4.19 billion U.S. dollars and on Prime Day, shopper conversion was much higher than the average rate of the preceding quarter.
