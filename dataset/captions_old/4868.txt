 260 patients died on the organ transplant waiting list while waiting for a kidney transplant in the United Kingdom (UK) during the period 2018/19, by far the highest number compared to other organs. In the year to March 2018, 63 and 45 people also died waiting for lung and liver transplants respectively. Transplant situation in the UK The number of people waiting for a kidney transplant in the UK was over 4.7 thousand in 2019, which was the highest for any organ by quite a distance. Again, this was followed by individuals waiting for liver transplants and lung transplants with 407 and 339 patients each respectively. The problem exists is that in 2017/18 the number of potential donors was over 4.5 times the number of actual donors in the UK. Survival chances after a transplant In the UK, the one-year survival rate after a kidney transplant is generally good. Since 2005, 99 percent of those receiving a kidney transplant from a living donor survived for at least one-year post-transplant. The survival rates from deceased donors are slightly below, sitting at a 97 percent survival rate for the period 2014 to 2017.
