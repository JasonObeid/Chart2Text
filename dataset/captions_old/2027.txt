 Cats are a popular choice in Europe when it comes to pet ownership, although we don’t see them outside as often as their canine friends. As shown in this statistic, Germany and France are the two countries leading the list of cat owners in the EU, with the former’s narrow win. While Germany also ranks as the top EU country with the highest number of pet dogs, cats still win in European households. EU loves cats Compared with the cat population in Germany, France and the United Kingdom, countries such as Latvia, Ireland and Estonia had a low number of household felines. Yet across Europe in general, the number of cats has gone up significantly since 2010. In 2017, the EU alone was home to a large population of cats, making them the most preferred pets. Cat food in pet care industry The population of household cats in the European Union also corresponds to the volume of the pet care industry in this region. Between 2010 and 2017, pet food industry achieved steady growth. In 2016, it was the cat food and accessories sales value that had the largest share in the pet care market.
