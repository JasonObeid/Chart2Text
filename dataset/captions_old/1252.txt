 In 2019, Turkey had the world’s largest reserves of natural graphite, at approximately 90 million metric tons. Graphite is a native element mineral and a semimetal, comprised of a crystalline allotrope of carbon. One of its well-known uses is as the 'lead' in pencils. Global graphite production World graphite production has recently decreased. In 2019, the total worldwide production of graphite amounted to 1.1 million metric tons, a decrease from the 2016 total of 1.15 million metric tons. In the past decade, China has consistently been the leading global graphite producer. In 2019, they produced an estimated 700,000 metric tons. Following China was Mozambique in a distant second place, with a production volume estimated at 100,000 metric tons that year. Global graphite market The global market value of graphite is expected to continue increasing. In 2016, the global market value of graphite was 12.5 billion U.S. dollars. It grew to 17.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2018, and is projected to increase to more than 27 billion U.S. dollars by 2025.
