 This statistic presents the development of share of current account holders, who use mobile banking to communicate with their bank at least once a month in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2010 to 2015. By 2015, it can be seen that 34 percent of respondents stated they used mobile banking at least once a month. The increases observed in mobile banking usage were steep over time: in 2010, only eight percent of current account holders on the British market turned monthly to mobile banking as a secure way of communicating with their bank. Compared to that share, the increase to 34 percent in 2015 marked the growth of over four times in five years. At the same time, the worries of mobile and mobile apps users with regards to security of their financial data have increased as well. Still, the positive reactions to the prospect of private data sharing by the UK banks amounted to nearly 40 percent of the sample studied in 2015; the negative reactions were measured at 30 percent.
