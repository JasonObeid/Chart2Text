 Consumption of natural gas in the United States reached a record high of 29.95 trillion cubic feet in 2018 and has risen by roughly a third since 1995. Natural gas consumption increased consistently from 2009 to 2016, after over a decade of fluctuation from 1995 to 2008. High demand for natural gas Natural gas is a colorless, odorless fossil fuel that comes from underground rock formations. It is typically used in the United States to heat homes. The electric power sector is currently responsible for the largest share of natural gas consumption in the United States, followed closely by the industrial sector. Consumption of natural gas by the electric power sector has nearly doubled since 2005, but remained lower than industrial sector consumption until 2012. Fossil fuels are still a common source Natural gas has the second-highest rate of consumption in the United States following petroleum. After the 2008 Recession, consumption of natural gas has increased more than any other energy source. The use of coal, however, has decreased significantly in the past decade as natural gas is seen as a lower-emission alternative and more cost-effective.
