 40-59-year-olds make up the largest age group in Germany, at 23.9 million people. The most recent figures from 2018 confirm that the next-largest age group was 65 years and older, at 17.88 million. Aging population With the number of people belonging to older age groups visibly outstripping younger ones, in recent years it has become clear that Germany’s population is aging more rapidly than developing. In fact, figures on age structure in Germany during the decade ending in 2017 depict a constant trend of a slowly increasing population share aged over 65. Meanwhile, the share of population members aged 0 to 14 years has been falling, which was also reflected in the fluctuating national birth rate in recent years. A look at the future Germany’s current total population stands at 82.79 million. While this number is predicted to increase, the same goes for the age group of 65 years and older. This means that the national population will continue to age.
