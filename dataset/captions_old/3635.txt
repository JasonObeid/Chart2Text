While Canada has significant financial centers such as Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver, it is also one of the largest countries in the world. To cover this geography, RBC has a particularly high number of employees for a bank of that size. Global perspective Not only is RBC the largest bank in Canada, its market capitalization makes it one of the largest banks in the world. Its private banking operations are a large driver of its value, with assets under management making it one of the leading private banks as well. These make RBC a major global player whose reach extends well beyond the Canadian border.
