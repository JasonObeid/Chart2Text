 Almost every Automated teller Machine (ATM) in the United Kingdom (UK) is a part of the Link network. During the previous 12-month period, an average of almost 230 million transactions using Link cash machines take place every month, accounting for an average of 10 billion British pounds in withdrawals. Free to use cash machines In 2018, over 80 percent of cash machines in the United Kingdom were free to use. Whether an ATM is free to use appears to be a very important factor as to if the machine is used to withdraw money. During 2018, free to use ATM’s accounted for 98 percent of withdrawals. The other two percent of withdrawals were made using the 14.6 thousand fee-based machines situated in the UK. ATM’s fall across Europe Between 2016 and 2018, the number of ATM’s in Europe has fallen by almost 14 thousand. Each ATM in Europe services an average of over 64 thousand individuals. The decrease in Automated Teller Machines in Europe has been a direct cause of the rise in cashless payments. Across the continent, people are choosing to use cards and mobile payments as their preferred process instead of the incumbency of using physical cash.
