 The share of United Kingdom households that own a home computer reached a plateau of 88 percent, starting in 2015/16. It wasn’t until 2002/03 that home computers could be found in a majority of households in the United Kingdom, when the rate of ownership jumped from 49 percent to 55 percent. Changing face of the home computer Although most households contain a computer, the actual device used is likely to have changed considerably in recent years. In 2010 the majority of households still reported owning a desktop PC or iMac computer, with 52 percent of people owning such a device. By 2018, this rate fell to just 28 percent. Laptops, conversely, have been on the rise, with the penetration rate increasing from 47 percent in 2009, to 63 percent in 2018. Laptop sales According to the most recent figures from the United Kingdom (UK) Office for National Statistics (ONS), the sales value of laptops, notebooks and palm-top organizers reached 58.79 billion British pounds in 2017. In that same year, 46 percent of respondents to a Statista survey reported buying a laptop every 3-5 years. Worldwide, total laptop sales are expected to reach 171 million units in 2023, up from 166 million units in 2019. Desktop sales are expected to contract, from 88.4 million units in 2019, to 79.5 million units by 2023.
