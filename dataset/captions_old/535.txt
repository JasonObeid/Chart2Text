 This statistic presents the number of pet dogs in the European Union by country, as of 2018. Germany ranked highest with a dog population of approximately 9.4 million in 2018, followed by the United Kingdom (UK) with nine million. The number of dogs in Europe has seen a notable increase since 2010, with the number of dogs significantly increasing by more than eleven million from 2010 to 2018. The total amount of number dogs reported in 2018 was estimated at 85.2 million. As the statistic shows, the United Kingdom is the leading European country for dogs, with over half of dogs owners owning a pedigree dog. This term defines a dog that has a traceable ancestry and breeding line. This may be useful to pet owners when looking for an animal with good health conditioning, or if the owner is interested in a very specific look for the dog. Pedigree dogs are predominantly bread for purchase. In Romania and Poland, at least 42 percent of the population own one dog at home, this is nearly double that of the United Kingdom where 25 percent of the population own a dog.
