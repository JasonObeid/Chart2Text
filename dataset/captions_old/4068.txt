 The direct to consumer segment accounted for 34 percent of Under Armour’s net sales in 2019. The company's main channel of distribution was wholesale that year. Under Armour’s global growth Under Armour’s total net revenue exceeded five billion U.S. dollars for the first time in 2018, helped by the company expanding its direct to consumer distribution channel in international markets: the American sportswear firm increased its global network of brand and factory house stores in the regions of Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Under Armour generate around four percent of their net sales from Latin America. This market has increased due to a growth in the number of direct to consumer channels in Mexico, Chile, and Brazil. The share of net sales from the Asia-Pacific region stands at twelve percent as a result of Under Armour expanding its direct to consumer channels in China. What are direct to consumer and wholesale sales? Direct to consumer sales refer to a brand – such as Under Armour – selling its products straight to the consumer without the need of an intermediary, most commonly through an official website or its brand and factory house stores – a brand house is a store that showcases a brand’s new lines and innovations, while a factory house is an outlet store that sells older products. Wholesale distribution refers to a brand supplying third-party retailers with its products in bulk. Both sales strategies were well represented in the ranking of leading sporting goods companies worldwide in 2018.
