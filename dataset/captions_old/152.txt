 The statistic shows the inflation rate in the United Kingdom from 1984 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. The inflation rate is calculated using the price increase of a defined product basket. This product basket contains products and services, on which the average consumer spends money throughout the year. They include expenses for groceries, clothes, rent, power, telecommunications, recreational activities and raw materials (e.g. gas, oil), as well as federal fees and taxes. In 2018, the average inflation rate in the United Kingdom was at about 2.48 percent compared to the previous year. For comparison, inflation in India amounted to 3.6 percent that same year.
