 This statistic shows the number of households in Canada that "cut the cord" with respect to their TV subscriptions from 2012 to 2018. According to the source, the number of households that cut their TV subscription amounted to 346 thousand households in 2018. Whilst predicted figures were higher, this is still a significant number and only a slight reduction from the 351 thousand who cut the cord in 2017.
