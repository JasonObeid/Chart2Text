 In 2018, the travel and tourism industry in India contributed around 247 billion U.S. dollars to the country’s GDP. In 2017, the country welcomed over 10 million foreign tourists , generating foreign exchange earnings of over 27.31 billion U.S. dollars. Domestic travel on the rise With a rich culture, ancient monuments, and mesmerizing natural beauty, India is one of the leading tourist destinations in the world. This holds true not only for foreign tourists, but also for the increasingly monied middle-class of the country who are spending more time and money than ever before on domestic travel. In 2017, the domestic expenditure on tourism was around 186 billion U.S. dollars. At the same time, the collective government spending on the tourism sector that year was about 2.61 billion dollars. The cost of tourism It comes as no surprise that out of the most visited monuments in India, the Taj Mahal in Agra ranks number one for both foreign as well as domestic tourists. Along with these popular tourist destinations, travellers are also exploring many other destinations in the country, like the pristine high-altitude plains of Leh and Ladakh or the lush green north-eastern forests. It now remains to be seen whether and how well the country manages to balance the influx of people with its efforts for the historical sites and natural resources conservation.
