Constantly on their phones According to Deloitte's Global Mobile Consumer Survey 2017, Italians ranked well above the European average in many aspects. For example, they ranked first for voice search and virtual assistant usage. At the same time, 40 percent of the respondents thought that they used their smartphone excessively. Only Spain ranked higher, with 46 percent of the respondents believing they used their smartphones too much.
