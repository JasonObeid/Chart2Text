 Sports Direct accomplished an impressive feat with its revenue figures in the past few years. The British sports fashion retailer registered a revenue of about 3.7 billion British pounds in 2019, doubling what it made in 2013. The retailer’s success owes much to a number of acquisitions made under its CEO Mike Ashley, who owns the football club New Castle United besides his reputation as a retail mogul. European stores nothing short of home numbers Sports Direct is an international sports fashion retailer with stores in numerous European countries. Currently, in the UK the retailer boasts a notable number of both own-brand stores and fascias owned by the group. In the meantime, the retailer’s European businesses are catching up with the UK, with ever increasing store number operating in this market. Keen on buy-outs Sports Direct loves saving high street retailers from their financial misery. Most recently, the Group fully acquired the department store House of Fraser after the retailer went into administration in August 2018. Since then, Sports Direct’s retail portfolio extended beyond sports fashion with hints at going in the same direction as the retailer was reported to eye more buy-outs.
