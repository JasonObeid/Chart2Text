 This statistic shows the U.S. underemployment rate on a monthly basis for the ongoing year. The survey is conducted doing daily telephone interviews among about 30,000 adults per month in the U.S. The graph shows the 30-day average for each month to depict an annual trend. The rate is created by adding unemployed workers, who are looking for work, to the amount of workers employed part time but seeking full-time work. In July 2017, the U.S. underemployment rate was 12.5 percent.
