 Infant mortality has been falling in Bangladesh in the past decade, from 43.2 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2008 to 25.1 in 2018. This figure helps to assess the overall healthcare system’s efficacy, because childbirth and infant care require more direct patient care than any other period of life. Similarly, measures taken to combat infant mortality often have spillover effects, improving the entire healthcare system. Population in Bangladesh Bangladesh has one of the highest population densities in the world. While the economy is growing at a fair rate, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is still low. This points to Bangladesh’s status as a developing nation. However, these indicators also suggest that the country continues to flourish. This development can benefit a significant number of people. Other development indicators As health outcomes improve, life expectancy should follow. This will lead to an upward shift in the population pyramid, which measures the age structure in a country. Such a change means that there are more workers in the medium term, increasing the country’s productivity. Productivity growth then enables more expenditure on health care, creating a virtuous cycle. For this reason, experts follow infant mortality closely.
