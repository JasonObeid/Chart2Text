 With 60 percent of the market share, Engie Electrabel reached the highest market share of electricity supply in the Brussels-Capital Region. The Belgian daughter of the French multinational Engie was, therefore, leading the market in this region of Belgium in 2019. Lampiris was the second-largest supplier, holding a market share of 19 percent. In Belgium, the major electricity providers were Engie Electrabel, Lampiris, and EDF-Luminus. Belgian electricity providers face regional differences Belgium is a country where regions and language communities have strong identities. The market for electricity suppliers is therefore different from one region to another, thus the share of providers on a national scale being nonsensical. From a regional perspective, Electrabel was leading the market in Wallonia and Flanders. However, Luminus was the second-largest provider in both regions, outcompeting Lampiris. In Flanders, the third-largest electricity provider was Eneco, further surpassing Lampiris. In 2018, Belgium produced 74.6 terawatt-hours and registered an unstable production since 2001. The price of electricity in the Brussels-Capital region In 2018, the annual residential electricity bill reached 783 euros in the Brussels-Capital Region (based on a consumption of 3.500 kWh from a single meter with a low-voltage network). However, the invoice was heftier in Wallonia and especially in Flanders, where it reached over a thousand euros. The inhabitants of the Brussels-Capital Region were, therefore, paying the least for their electricity compared to other parts of the country.
