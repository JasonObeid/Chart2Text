 The Eurostar high-speed train brings passengers from one side of the Channel, which separates the United Kingdom from Continental Europe, to the other. Much to the pleasure of the passengers heading to or departing from the Lille Railway station, this train registered a rate of delay (of more than half an hour) of 0 percent, making it one of the most punctual European trains in 2016. Eurostar has a high perception in the UK Usually, the high volume of passengers combined with the long distances covered by this train, could signify a decrease in the quality of the service provided. But this doesn’t seem to be the case for the Eurostar group. As of June 2018, the Eurostar group had a BrandIndex value of 14.7 making it the second-highest rated transport service provider in the United Kingdom. It is important to notice that this index is calculated by taking the average of Impression, Quality, Satisfaction and Reputation. Travelling with the Eurostar is usually more expensive In 2016, the high-speed trains and the Shuttle belonging to the Eurostar group transported roughly 20 million passengers . Yet, the high-prices for short-distance travels as the London-Paris route, seem to drive many passengers to favoring other less expensive ways of travelling. For instance, the Irish low-cost airline, Ryanair, offers a flight from London Luton to Nîmes (in the South of France). Between 2016 and 2017, Ryanair transported around 120 million passengers, around a twelvefold of the number of passengers transported by the Eurostar in 2016. This airline also achieved an annual revenue of roughly 6.6 billion euros .
