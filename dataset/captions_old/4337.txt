 This statistic shows the Employment Cost Index for all employees in the United States from 2010 to 2019, by quarter. The index is based on numbers from December 2005. The Employment Cost Index (ECI) measures the change in the cost of labor, free from the influence of employment shifts among occupations and industries. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the ECI came to 138.9, indicating an increase of labor costs by almost one percent since the preceding quarter.
