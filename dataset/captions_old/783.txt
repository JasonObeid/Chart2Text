 Lennar Corp, a home construction company headquartered in Miami Florida, was the leading home builder by gross revenue in the United States in 2018. They earned 18.8 billion U.S. dollars in that year. Lennar Homebuilding was their most profitable segment in terms of revenue in 2018. Residential construction is on the rise The number of private housing units started fell around the time of the global financial crisis (2007-2009), but has since recovered – though not to the heights of 2006. Home construction expenditure has been steadily increasing since 2011. This trend is set to continue through 2022, which indicates that the revenues earned by home construction companies, such as D.R. Horton, will also continue to increase. New home sales follow the same trend Unsurprisingly, the number of new houses sold follows the same pattern. The property crash of 2008, which was a leading factor in the global financial crisis at that time, impacted residential property sales in the United States. However, this market has also recovered since then and has been on the rise since 2011. The number of homes started began to increase from 2009 onwards, but the increase in home sales didn’t commence until two years later. This time lag is logical, as buyers often lack confidence in the property market after such a catastrophic incident as a property crash.
