 Spain is gradually becoming older, or so it seems when looking at the latest studies which forecast that the average Spaniard would be 52.3 years old by the year 2050. The Mediterranean country featured a median age of 27.5 years old in 1950, but this trend shifted towards a steady ageing of the Spanish population in the subsequent years. Spain’s median age was expected to reach approximately 45 years by 2020. The depopulation of a country The population of Spain has been in decline for many years and was projected to decrease by nearly one million by 2023. This will not come as a surprise since Spain has the lowest fertility rate in the European Union, with barely 1.34 children per woman according to the latest reports. During the last ten years, the country featured a continuous population density of approximately 93 inhabitants per square kilometer – a figure far from the European average, which stood nearly at 121 inhabitants per square kilometer in 2017. Ageing: a common problem across the continent Data related to age in the Mediterranean country essentially behave in a similar fashion as the rest of its European counterparts, whose population is also slowly but surely getting older. This will not come as a surprise since Spain has one of the highest life expectancies at birth in the world and the lowest European fertility rate, which stood at 1.34 children per woman according to the latest reports.
