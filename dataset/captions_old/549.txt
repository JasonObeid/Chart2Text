 Between 2010 and 2013, there was a noticeable increase in the price of electricity for households in Germany. At the start of the decade households paid less than 24 euro cents per kilowatt-hour. However, this increased by more than five euro cents by the second half of 2013. In the preceding years prices remained relatively stable, peaking at 30.48 euro cents in 2017. By the first half of 2019, German households were paying 30.88 euro cents per kilowatt-hour. Electricity prices worldwideElectricity prices in Germany are some of the highest worldwide, and only cheaper than Denmark throughout Europe. In 2018, German customers were charged 0.33 U.S. dollars per kilowatt-hour. Although production is cheap, additional taxes and fees increase the final cost. Renewable surcharge One of the additional fees that increases electricity prices is the renewable surcharge. In 2019, this surcharge made up 21 percent of the final composition of power prices for German households. This levy is to support Germany’s renewables expansion, such as wind, solar, biomass and hydropower installations.
