GDP is the total market value of all final goods and services that have been produced within a country within a given period of time, usually a year.

Canada is one of the largest economies in the world and is counted among the globe’s wealthiest nations. It has a relatively small labor force in comparison to some of the world’s other largest economic powers, amounting to just under 19 million. Unemployment in Canada has remained relatively high as the country has battled against the tide of economic woe that swept across the majority of the world after the 2008 financial meltdown, and although moving in the right direction, there is still some way to go for Canada. Canada is among the leading trading nations worldwide, owing to the absolutely vast supplies of natural resources, which make up a key part of the Canadian trading relationship with the United States, the country with which Canada trades by far the most. In recent years, around three quarters of Canadian exports went to the United States and just over half of its imports came from its neighbor to the south. The relationship is very much mutually beneficial; Canada is the leading foreign energy supplier to the United States.
