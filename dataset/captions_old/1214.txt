 This statistic represents the leading companies in the global industrial robot market in 2017, based on industrial robot revenue. In that year, Fanuc generated some 1.7 billion euros from industrial robot sales. Industrial robot market Although industrial robots have made inroads into a growing number of industries such as the food and beverages industry, the highly automated car manufacturing sector remains the largest area of application for electro-mechanical machines. The robotics industry’s growth trend is largely driven by rising wage levels that force manufacturers worldwide to replace human labor with machines. Asia and Europe are home to the key players in the market, including ABB, KUKA, Fanuc and the Yaskawa Electric Corporation. With relevant sales of around 1.2 billion euros, Japan-based Yaskawa was ranked among the largest manufacturers of industrial robots in 2017. The company’s heavy duty industrial robots can be used for welding, assembly, coating, materials handling, materials cutting, materials removal and spot welding. In the 2017 fiscal year, Yaskawa generated almost 450 billion Japanese yen in net sales. The robotics industry is a subsector of the automation industry. This industry is comprised of a variety of products and services, including relays, switches, sensors and drives, machine vision and control systems, as well as industry software development and services. Conglomerates like Siemens, Mitsubishi Electric or General Electric are the major vendors of industrial automation and industry software.
