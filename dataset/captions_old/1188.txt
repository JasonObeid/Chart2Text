Wealth distribution in India India’s wealth is very unevenly distributed, with the wealthiest one percent of inhabitants owning more than half of the wealth. Currently, the majority of Indians own less than 10,000 U.S. dollars in wealth and assets and over 80 percent of Indian households have an average monthly income of 20,000 Indian rupees (about 286 U.S. dollars) or less – and even less in rural areas.
