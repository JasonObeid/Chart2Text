 In 2018, Seat topped the list of most passenger cars registrations in Spain. The Spanish car brand saw the number of registrations amounting to over 107 thousand in 2018. The most registered SEAT models were SEAT Leon and SEAT Ibiza, both exceeding 30 thousand registrations during 2018. Germany: Europe‘s indisputable car manufacturer Second in this list is Volkswagen. The German car manufacturer VW Group held the largest market share of passenger cars in Europe as of February 2019, taking up 24.4 percent of the total market. Moreover, Germany was the European country that most recorded passenger car registrations, with nearly 4 million new cars on the country’s roads in 2017. The popularity of cars in Germany comes as no surprise, since the European country houses a few of the largest automobile groups in the continent. The slump of diesel engines According to the latest studies, Europe has been experiencing a shift in consumer behavior when purchasing a car. This is particularly visible in the preferred type of engine that the Europeans tended to acquire in recent years. Sales of diesel models have been recording a downtrend since 2013 in all European countries, presumably explained by the 2015 diesel scandal and subsequent discussions surrounding health and environmental impacts of the fuel type.
