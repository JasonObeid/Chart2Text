 In 2016, data forecast expected retail sales of food items in the UK to increase by 1.1 percent in 2017 and 0.9 percent in 2018. The market value of grocery retail grew by about 3.1 percent in 2017. Looking at the possible impacts of Brexit, any forecast currently faces additional uncertainties that make predicting the development of the UK market much more difficult. Grocery retail in the UK Looking at sales channel distribution of the 185 billion British pound grocery market in 2017, the largest amount of sales was made by supermarkets with 88 billion pounds. Following at a distant second with less than half of these sales come convenience stores and at only 21 billion British pounds, the discounters took third place. Online grocery shopping Even though the UK is one of the leading countries for online grocery shopping, the channel only accounts for 10.7 billion in grocery sales. However, the online sales value has been continually growing for years and only recently fell under five percent growth for the first time since the start of 2013.
