 As of 2017, right-wing American news website Breitbart was rated as not at all credible by 18 percent of respondents from a survey of over two thousand U.S. adults. Additionally, over half of respondents had either never heard of the publication or had no opinion about Breitbart’s credibility. Conservative view of news media While right-wing websites and online publications have grown in number and popularity in recent years, Fox News remains the largest and perhaps most influential conservative news source in the United States. On the whole, people who identify as Republicans seem to be extremely skeptical of news media, with a large majority stating that they believe that the American news media abuses its First Amendment right to freedom of the press. Fake news The current political climate in the U.S. has given rise to increasingly divisive opinions regarding the truthfulness, objectivity, and credibility of many American news sources. While both sides of the isle tend to agree that social media is the most common source of fake news and misinformation, they differ greatly in terms of their opinions of sources like Fox News and MSNBC.
