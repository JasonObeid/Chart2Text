 In the period 2018/19, 779 liver transplants were carried out in England, followed by 114 conducted in Scotland. England has by far the largest population of the countries in the United Kingdom, so it is unsurprising it has the highest number of transplants performed in a year. State of liver transplants in the UK The number of liver transplants in the United Kingdom in 2018/19 was an five percent increase from the number that took place in the preceding year. However, the quantity of liver transplants in the UK still needs to increase to match the numbers waiting on the organ waiting list, as in 2019, a total of 407 individuals were actively waiting for a liver transplant. Alcohol as a contributor In England in the last ten years, the number of hospital admissions for liver disease as a result of alcohol consumption has increased. Going from around 38.3 thousand admissions in 2007/08 to almost 62 thousand in the year 2016/17. If this continues to increase, then the number of people requiring liver transplants will subsequently rise as well.
