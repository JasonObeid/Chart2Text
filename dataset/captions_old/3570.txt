 In 2018/19 the number of overall crime offences in the United Kingdom reached approximately 6.3 million, an increase of around 430 thousand offences when compared with 2017/18. Although crime figures were slightly higher in the early 2000s, they were far lower in 2013/14, when just 4.4 million crimes were recorded in the UK. More with less The rise in crime witnessed during this period has led to serious questions about how to reverse this trend, and if the police have enough manpower and resources to counter it. Due to austerity measures pursued by British governments after 2010, police forces were forced to cut officer numbers in successive years between 2010 and 2018, resulting in a net decrease of over 20 thousand officers. While there was a slight increase in public sector expenditure on the police force in 2017/18 and 2018/19, the 17.99 billion British pounds spent in the most recent year was still less than the 19.3 billion spent in 2009/10. Crime rates higher in Northern England The three regions in England and Wales with the highest crime rate in this year were the North East, the North West and Yorkshire. London, the UK capital also had a relatively high crime rate of 98 crimes per 1,000 people while the South West of England had the lowest crime rate of 67.8 crimes per 1,000 people.
