Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the total number of Bitcoins in circulation by the Bitcoin price. The Bitcoin market capitalization increased from approximately 1.02 billion U.S. dollars in the second quarter of 2013 to peak at 238 billion U.S. dollars in the fourth quarter of 2017. It currently sits at 169.44 billion U.S. dollars Bitcoin – additional information While its market capitalization grew at an unbelievable rate from 2013 to 2017, the public is only slowly becoming aware of its existence. As many as 25 percent of Americans were still not familiar with bitcoin and as of 2019. While there are over 18 million bitcoins in circulation, there are only 6,674 Bitcoin ATMs around the world. So its physical presence is minimal, and the majority of ATMs are located in the United States.

It is also unique because an account is easy to set up and it is completely transparent. The bitcoin price index (the average bitcoin price across leading global exchanges) has also increased significantly since its creation, rising from 367 U.S. dollars in January 2016 to a peak of over 13,000 U.S. dollars at the end of December 2017.
