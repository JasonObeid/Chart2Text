 In 2020, it was forecasted that Malaysians would consume an estimated 49.4 kilograms of poultry meat per person. This puts Malaysia amongst the top global consumers of poultry meat worldwide. Meat production has been proven to have adverse effects on the environment and global climate, and scientists have recommended drastically reducing the amount of mean consumed. However, Malaysian consumers were still reluctant to give up their meat. Climate impact of poultry consumption In 2015, the global per capita consumption of poultry meat was 13.8 kilograms, compared to 47.26 kilograms in Malaysia. While poultry meat produced less greenhouse gas emissions compared to cattle, they still produced the second highest amount of emissions per kilocalorie out of a range of agricultural products. With such high levels of poultry consumption, as well as beef, the average diet of the Malaysian consumer could be said to be harmful for the environment and climate. Consumer reluctance to go meat-free While vegetarianism and veganism are increasing in popularity globally, Malaysian consumers were not yet jumping on the meat-free trend. An overwhelming majority of Malaysian consumers were unwilling to go vegetarian. Completely giving up meat might not be feasible for the average person. With the recent advances in plant-based proteins, however, reducing meat consumption by using meat substitutes without compromising on taste were becoming viable options. Even so, more than half of Malaysian consumers were still unwilling to substitute meat for plant-based alternatives.
