 The annual revenue of Debenhams has fallen flat in the past decade, stagnating around 2.2 million British pounds in 2018 as displayed in this statistic. One of the household names in UK high streets, Debenhams went into administration in April 2019, after rejecting Sports Direct’s buyout offer. Since then, Debenhams has been involved in yet more legal drama with its creditors and landlords, as well as Sports Direct’s renewed attempts to derail if not devour the department store retailer. International markets Debenhams is one of the oldest department stores in the United Kingdom. Established in 1778 in London, the retailer is active in Denmark, in addition to the UK and Ireland. In fact, revenue coming from Denmark makes this country the biggest market after the UK. Woes of department stores It is not just Debenhams that is struggling with sales and maintaining its position in UK high streets. Marks and Spencer and House of Fraser are two other department store retailers whose share in this market has shrunk in recent years. In fact, House of Fraser is another department store retailer to have gone into administration and eventually be bought by Sports Direct in 2018.
