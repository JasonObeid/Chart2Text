Which player has the most triple doubles? Oscar Robertson - nicknamed ‘The Big O’, is the all-time leader in triple doubles in the National Basketball Assocation.

In the National Basketball Association statistical categories are kept on a per game basis for each individual player including points, rebounds, assists and steals. When a player reaches a score of ten or more in at least three of these statistical categories in a game, he records a triple double (e.g. 10 points, 10 assists, 10 rebounds). All the players on the list with at least 100 triple doubles in their career are versatile, strong, and athletic guards able to handle the ball on the offensive end. This enables these players to score at a high level and assist on many other baskets. Their size and basketball smarts often also make them good rebounders.
