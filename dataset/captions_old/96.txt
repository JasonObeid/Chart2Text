 Serena Williams has won the most Grand Slam titles of all time during her career, with a total of 23 Grand Slam tournament victories. She pulled clear of Steffi Graf to take the overall lead in the rankings after her success at the 2017 Australian Open, in which she beat her sister, Venus Williams, in the final. Queens of the court Serena Williams is undoubtedly one of the best female tennis players of all time. Of her 23 Grand Slam titles to date, seven each came at the Australian Open and at Wimbledon. Along with her six victories at the U.S. Open and her three French Open titles, she is one of only two female players in the Open Era to have won each of the major tournaments three times or more. The other player to join her in that exclusive club is Steffi Graf, who holds the record for the total number of weeks at No. 1 in the WTA rankings. Can Williams match Navratilova? While Serena Williams tops the list for most Grand Slam titles, it is Martina Navratilova who holds the record for most singles titles on the WTA circuit. While Serena Williams has won 14 Grand Slam doubles titles with her sister, Venus, Navratilova managed an impressive 31 Grand Slam doubles wins during her career, as well as 177 overall doubles titles. Navratilova won titles with several different partners, but her most successful doubles pairing was with Pam Shriver, with whom she won 21 Grand Slam titles between 1981 and 1989. Impressively, Navratilova reached the final of the 2003 U.S. Open at the age of 46, some 13 years after her latest Grand Slam doubles success at the same tournament. In 2003, however, she lost out in the final with her partner, Svetlana Kuznetsova, marking Navratilova’s last appearance in a Grand Slam doubles final.
