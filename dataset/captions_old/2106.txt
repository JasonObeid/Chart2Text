 When asked what they think are the most important issues the Netherlands is currently facing, 66 percent of survey respondents stated to worry about the climate and environment. Another 31 percent was concerned about health and social security. By comparison, relatively few people named the government debt or unemployment. Four percent considered terrorism as one of the main issues the country has to deal with. Concern about global warming Climate change is a top concern among all generations in the Netherlands. A 2018 poll in which respondents were asked whether they consider global warming problematic or not, over two thirds of respondents in all age groups stated to consider it (very) problematic. Concern was highest among those older than 55 years (78 percent), but among the participants younger than 35 years 67 percent also stated to consider climate change a problem. Fear of terrorist attacks Although relatively few people stated to consider terrorism one of the main issues, another 2019 survey found that terrorism is still something that worries a considerable amount of Dutch. Over 30 percent of survey participants answered to worry a lot about terrorism, whereas only 23 percent did not worry at all about it, or very little.
