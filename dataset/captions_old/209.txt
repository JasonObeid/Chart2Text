 No game of baseball is complete without a trip to the concessions stand, but how much money a fan needs to part with in order to get their hands on a hot dog varies widely from team to team. While a hot dog at the home games of the Baltimore Orioles would set you back just 1.5 U.S. dollars, the same snack at Citi Field during a New York Mets game would cost you 6.75 U.S. dollars. Digging deep for snacks It seems that baseball in the Big Apple does not come cheap. As well as the 6.75 U.S. dollars for a hot dog, the smallest beer offered at the New York Mets costs an eye-watering 11 U.S. dollars. The picture is slightly better on the other side of Rikers Island at the New York Yankees. In the Yankee Stadium, a small beer costs six U.S. dollars, a figure that is roughly average for the league. Soft drinks, meanwhile, are priced at a reasonable three U.S. dollars at the Yankees and 5.75 U.S. dollars at the Mets, although the size of the portions does vary from stadium to stadium. Overall, treating yourself to some snacks during the ball game has become increasingly expensive. Prices for beer, soft drinks, and hot dogs have all seen a significant increase between 2010 and 2019. Following your team does not come cheap Nothing beats watching your favorite baseball team play live in the stadium, but this enjoyment comes at a cost. The whole experience, including food and merchandise, for a family of four cost a league-wide average of 234.38 U.S. dollars in the 2019 season. The most expensive day out was at the Chicago Cubs, where a family would have to fork out over 370 U.S. dollars. Fans of the Arizona Diamondbacks, meanwhile, would only have to pay just over 142 U.S. dollars to experience their team live.
