 The science fiction movie 2.0 was ranked as the all-time highest budget movie in India with a production value of almost six billion Indian rupees. Saaho, another action thriller produced in 2019 became the second highest big-budget film costing over 3.2 billion rupees. The business of Bollywood The Indian film industry was valued at over 180 billion rupees in fiscal year 2019, and it was estimated to reach up to 260 billion rupees by the end of fiscal year 2024. Out of this, the highest earnings came from domestic theatrical revenues, worth almost 125 billion rupees. In fact, the country's film industry recorded a 15.3 percent growth in revenue that year compared to fiscal year 2018. One of the main reasons for this growth was the revived focus on regional cinema, along with revenue from other sources like in-cinema advertising, digital rights distribution and music use and distribution rights. Quality over quantity However, higher budgets do not necessarily mean profitable movies. Case in point - 2019 film Uri-The Surgical Strike. This was produced at a budget of around 420 million rupees- far lower than 2.0 or Saaho. And yet, the film managed to get a whopping 876 percent return on investments, surpassing the combined costs of its advertisements as well as production expenses within just ten days of its release. Perhaps Bollywood producers can learn a lesson or two from this about the triumph of quality over quantity.
