 In the year 2018, Nissan led the Finnish sales ranking of passenger car models with their crossover SUV model Qashqai, selling roughly 5.5 thousand cars. The Japanese car manufacturer maintained a margin of 500 cars to the runner-up Škoda Octavia, which sold five thousand passenger cars in the country. Volkswagen leads the sales of used cars While Nissan took the lead in selling the most newly registered passenger cars of a single model, they were not as successful when it came to the sales of used cars in the same year. The brand did not manage to make it to the top 10 of most sold used cars, as consumers favored models such as Volkswagen Golf and Škoda Octavia. Overall, the brands leading the used car sales ranking in Finland were Volkswagen, Volvo, and Toyota. Nissan’s sales have recently experienced recent fluctuations in the Nordic countries The sales numbers of Nissan showed a fluctuating trend in recent years in Finland, as the number of cars sold varied between 5.9 thousand and 7.5 thousand units. Other Nordic countries experienced a similar pattern. In the last ten years, sold car numbers of Nissan have fluctuated between 3.4 thousand and 10.6 thousand in Sweden, and between 1.9 thousand and 10.1 thousand in Denmark. However, in these countries the sales numbers showed a clear increasing trend, unlike in Finland.
