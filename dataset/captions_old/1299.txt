 Over the past two decades, the average wind speed in the United Kingdom has remained relatively stable. In 2019, the average wind speed in the UK was 8.2 knots. Speeds peaked during this period in 2015 at 9.4 knots, before falling to 8.4 knots the following year. One knot equates to one nautical mile per hour. Overall, wind speeds have mostly remained between eight and nine knots, dropping to a low of 7.8 in 2010. First and fourth quarters the windiest Since 2010, the first and fourth quarters of each year generally recorded the highest wind speeds. The highest quarterly wind speed averages occurred in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2014 at approximately 11 knots. Between 2014 and 2019, the most noticeable deviation from the 10-year mean was recorded in December 2015. In this month wind speeds were 4.1 knots higher than normal. Optimal wind conditions for wind energy The United Kingdom has some of the best wind conditions in Europe for wind power, so it is no surprise that it plays an important role in the country’s energy mix. By the end of 2018, there were 39 offshore wind farms with grid connected turbines in the UK, by far the most in Europe. In the same year wind power in the UK produced 55.8 terawatts of electricity.
