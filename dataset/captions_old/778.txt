Leading container shipping companies worldwide based on number of ships Global seaborne trade was revolutionized in the 1950s, when the intermodal container became ready for commercialization. Prior to the introduction of standard containers, cargo shipping used to be a lot more expensive, as well as time-consuming. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defined the capacity of intermodal containers, making the twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU) a standard measure used in the transportation industry. Today, between 80 and 90 percent of containers shipped around the world are either forty or twenty foot standard length containers. The world’s largest container ship operator, APM Maersk, has the capacity to transport around 4.2 million TEU containers on its ships. The Danish shipper has some 691 container ships in its fleet, fully owning 314 of them.
