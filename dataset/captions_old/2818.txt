 This statistic shows the results of a survey that asked British adults which types of tea, if any, they ever drink in Great Britain (GB) in 2014. English breakfast tea ranked highest with a 52 percent share of respondents, followed by Green tea (23 percent) and Earl Grey (22 percent). A majority of British consumers drink tea on a daily basis, with earlier times in the day the peak period for tea drinking. Tea can be drank with milk as 'white' or without as 'black', of which both methods are almost equally popular. Levels of consumption, however, are on the decline as the United Kingdom moves closer to becoming a nation of coffee drinkers rather than tea drinkers, as seen in the rising value of the market for hot drinks. Other tea types, such as fruit and herbal teas, are also gaining ground as consumers seek the health and wellness benefits of such products.
