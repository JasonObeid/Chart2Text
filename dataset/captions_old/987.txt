 This statistic displays the annual exchange rate (average or standardized measure) of the euro to the Swiss franc (EUR CHF), according to data from the European Central Bank, from the introduction of the euro in 1999 up until 2019. The average, or standardized, measure shows the calculation based on many observations throughout the period in question, which is different than an annual measure at point in time: this denotes concrete values as of specific day (i.e. end of the year). Between the years of 2002 and 2007, the average annual exchange rate of the euro to the Swiss franc noted an increase. In 2007, the euro to Swiss franc annual average exchange rate was equal to 1.64, which meant that one euro could buy 1.64 Swiss francs. By 2019, this value had decreased overall, to a value of 1.11 which meant that one euro could buy 1.11 Swiss francs. This decrease in average annual euro to Swiss franc exchange rate is reflected in the monthly exchange rate, measured as of end-of-month in recent years.
