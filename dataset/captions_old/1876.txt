 Video gaming giant, Electronic Arts, generated net revenue of over one billion U.S. dollars in its 2019 fiscal year. While this marks a slight decrease on the revenue from the previous year, it still depicts a positive overall trend considering the company recorded net losses between 2008 and 2011. EA revenue Founded in 1982, EA was one of the first companies to explore the idea of home computer games and, in the ensuing decades, has been responsible for legendary game franchises such as FIFA, Madden NFL, and The Sims. The company generated net revenue of 4.95 billion U.S. dollars in 2019, over two million U.S. dollars of which was generated in North America. Given that EA is known for its wide range of console games, it is no surprise that the company generates most of its revenue from console gaming – approximately 3.33 billion U.S. dollars of revenue was generated in this segment in 2019, whilst all of the other segments generated less than 1.7 billion U.S. dollars combined. However, in the age of mobile gaming where people want to play games wherever and whenever, EA has seen its mobile revenue more than double since 2014. EA’s future Despite its reputation as a gaming giant, EA cannot afford to rest on its laurels with so many other players entering the gaming world. The company spent 702 million U.S. dollars on marketing and sales expenditures in 2019, marking a slight increase on the previous year’s figure. With future releases including the new editions of the FIFA and Madden series, as well as a new Star Wars game emerging in late 2019, the next few years look to be vital in determining EA’s future success.
