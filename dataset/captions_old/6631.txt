 Consumer lending (excluding student loans) in the United Kingdom (UK) equaled approximately 25 billion British pounds in October 2019, the slight decrease from the previous month. Consumer lending includes loans and advances to individuals through credit cards and personal loans. The majority of consumer credit is through credit card lending. Mortgage lending In comparison to consumer lending, the value of outstanding mortgage lending in the UK is far higher. In the first quarter of 2019, the total value of gross mortgage lending in the UK amounted to over 61 billion British pounds. Credit card payments With over 18 billion British pounds in gross consumer lending through credit cards, it’s unsurprising that there are almost as many credit cards as people in the UK. Of the 61.6 million plus credit card in issue in the UK, under seventy percent are actually active. The average amount spent per purchase on credit cards in the UK is over fifty British pounds in 2018.
