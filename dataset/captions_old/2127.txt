 This statistic displays the period which consumers are most likely to begin buying holiday gifts in the United States as of September 2019. Some 35 percent of survey respondents stated that they were likely to start their holiday shopping before the end of October in 2019. Holiday Season in the United StatesThe holiday season is just around the corner and it’s truly the best time of the year for both consumers and retailers of all shapes and sizes. Since the recession in 2008, Christmas holiday retail sales in the United States have grown steadily. In 2014, Christmas retail sales grew to about 620 billion U.S. dollars; a 4.1 percent increase from the previous year. The amount of money that U.S. consumers plan to spend on gifts has, however, fluctuated. A November 2018 survey revealed that U.S. consumers expected to spend, on average, 794 U.S. dollars in 2018; a decrease from 862 dollars in 2017. Ever the optimists, Millennials are approaching the holiday season with more vigor than older shoppers — putting them squarely at the top of many retailers' wish lists. A survey by Shullman Research Center revealed that 57 percent of U.S. holiday shoppers in 2015 will be Millennials. Black Friday is also the day most Millennials plan to begin their holiday shopping; roughly 67 percent according to a survey by Russell Research. For millions of people, Black Friday is the time to do some serious Christmas shopping --even before the last of the Thanksgiving leftovers are gone! It is the Friday after Thanksgiving, and it's one of the major shopping days of the year in the United States -falling anywhere between November 23 and 29. While it's not recognized as an official US holiday, many employees have the day off -except those working in retail. Ever since the start of the modern Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in 1924, the Friday after Thanksgiving has been known as the unofficial start to a bustling holiday shopping season.
