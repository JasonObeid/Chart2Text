 The trade union density for the United Kingdom in 2018 was 23.4 percent, an increase of 0.01 percent when compared with 2017. In 1995, the share of employees who were members of a trade union was 32.4 percent, nine percent more than 2018. Uniting the unions In 2016/17 one the biggest Trade Unions in the United Kingdom was Unite, with a membership of over 1.28 million people. Unite was created in 2007 through the merger of Amicus and the Transport and General Workers Union, with Amicus itself being created in 2002 through the merger of the Manufacturing Science and Finance Union and the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. Unions in decline The decline in union membership as well as the mergers of smaller unions has led to decrease in the number of trade unions. Compared with 1999/2000 there were 84 fewer unions in 2016/17. Of these unions seven had memberships of 250 thousand or more, and 23 had less than 100.
