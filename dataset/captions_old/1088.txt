 The Conservative party were the clear victors in the United Kingdom's general election of 2019, winning 365 seats out of 650, meaning they now have a majority of 80 seats in the House of Commons. Boris Johnson will continue as Prime Minister, but in a far stronger position than before, while the leader of the Labour party, Jeremy Corbyn will resign before the next election. What does it mean for Brexit? As a consequence of this result, the United Kingdom will almost certainly leave the European Union by the end of January 2020. Prior to this election, both Johnson and his predecessor, Theresa May, had such a small majority in the UK parliament that they had to rely on Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party for support, as well as hardline factions within the Conservative party. This weak position cost both Johnson and May key votes on Brexit in the House of Commons, leading directly to this general election.Labour's worst result since 1935 The Conservative party's main rivals the Labour Party suffered their worst defeat since 1935, after seeing their share of the vote decline by 7.8 percent. Due to the nature of the UK's voting system, this translated into a loss of 59 seats across the whole country, with historic losses recorded in the party's traditional heartlands of Northern England.
