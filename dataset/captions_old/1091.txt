 As released by the Italian association of foreign car makers (UNRAE), among the ten best-selling cars in 2019 three of the models belonged to the Fiat group. Fiat Panda was by far the most popular model reaching 138,132 units sold, followed by Lancia Ypsilon and Dacia Duster. Other foreign brands appear in the leading car brands, such as Ford and Volkswagen. Patriotism or costs and benefits? The ranking clearly points at the major role played by small cars due to multiple aspects such as fuel consumption, taxation, general maintenance, insurance and product life cycle. Besides Fiat Panda (which is a segment A car), the first five position are taken by segment B cars such as the French Renault Clio, with 41,683 units sold. The majority of Italians are not yet into electric cars Although Italians are concerned about the environment and emissions into the atmosphere, electric cars were not ranked high among the most sold cars in Italy. However, their sales volume was forecasted to increase in the coming years. According to a 2018 survey of Kantar, the share of new car buyers who bought alternative vehicles in Italy reached 14 percent for CNG and LPG vehicles and seven percent for hybrid electric cars.
