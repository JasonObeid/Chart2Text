 The average domestic heating oil price in Canada reached about 1,160 Canadian dollars per 1,000 liters in November 2019. There are three types of middle distillate fuel oils that can be used for liquid-fuel-burning equipment without any preheating, and three other types that require preheating as they contain residual fuel components. There are both federal and provincial regulations that are applicable to heating oils in Canada, including the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. Oil vs natural gas heating Most houses in North America use a central furnace for space heating. In gas or oil fueled furnaces, the fuel is mixed with air and burned. However, most of Canada’s residential space heating is fueled by natural gas, especially as many new homeowners switch out oil heat furnaces in favor of natural gas equipment. Despite the common transition towards natural gas, heating oil tends to burn hotter than natural gas and thus, efficiently heats spaces in a much shorter time. Oil furnaces tend to last much longer than natural gas furnaces.
