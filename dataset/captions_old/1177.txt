Some online retailers are based on brick-and-mortar stores, whereas others are purely online retailing corporations. Most notable examples for online-based companies are market leaders Amazon and eBay. Prerequisites for online shopping are an internet connection and a valid method of payment. After purchasing, products are usually shipped to a designated address, picked up in-store or made available for digital distribution. Online retail provides 24 hours access to customers, as well as the possibility to shop around with ease and compare prices. Online retail sites often feature customer-written reviews in addition to the standard product information.
