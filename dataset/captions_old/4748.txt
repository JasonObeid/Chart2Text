 This statistic depicts the perceived influences on consumer purchasing of eyewear in the United States in 2012. The survey revealed that 27 percent of the respondents are influenced into eyewear purchases as a result of doctor recommendations.Eyewear in the United StatesAfter suffering three consistent years of value sales declines, the eyewear market in the US began to emerge from the depths of the economic recession in 2011 and 2012. While the economy remains weaker than it was before the recession, GDP growth, a declining unemployment rate, and rising levels of consumer confidence led consumers to once again invest in vision correction products.Innovative new product launches and pent-up consumer demand to update the style and prescription of their spectacles has helped retail value sales of eyewear to finally return to their pre-recessionary levels in 2012.Contact lenses once again outperformed spectacles in 2012, continuing a trend that has been ongoing for many years. Americans are increasingly turning to contact lenses as their primary form of vision correction for reasons ranging from comfort and convenience to cosmetic appeal and practicality in athletics. The market has witnessed increased demand for contact lenses as they are increasingly viewed as a style statement. For example, the emergence of wearing fashionable and coloured contact lenses as well as specialty contact lenses that can make a person's eyes look bigger and shinier have attracted customers to a considerable extent. They are proving to be extremely popular among teenagers as well as adults.Some companies, like Luxottica, remain focused on the manufacture of spectacle frames and sunglasses, while others like Essilor, specialize in creating innovative spectacle lenses. Luxottica is actually the largest eyewear company in the world, responsible for such brands as Ray-Ban, Persol, Oakley, Burberry, Polo Ralph Lauren, Versace and many others.
