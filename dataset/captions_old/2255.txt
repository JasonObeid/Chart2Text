 Since the first half of 2010, household electricity prices in Czechia have seen an overall increase, rising to 17.48 euro cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) in the first half of 2019. This was the highest price during the reporting period. Prices dropped noticeably between 2014 and the first half of 2015, with households paying less than 13 euro cents per kWh. Households with an annual consumption of 2,500 kWh to 5,000 kWh tended to pay more for their electricity compared to those with a consumption of between 1,000 kWh and 2,499 kWh. Electricity generation Over the past two decades the generation of electricity in Czechia has slightly increased, rising from 74.6 terawatt-hours (tWh) in 2001 to 88 tWh by 2018. Much of this electricity is generated by fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. Despite the country’s reliance on fossil fuels, their shares in the energy mix have fallen steadily since 2007, dropping from 66 percent to 56 percent by 2015. Renewable energy increasing Whist the share of fossil fuels used in the generation of electricity has fallen, renewable energy shares have increased. In 2007, renewable sources accounted for less than five percent of the nation’s energy mix. Over the course of 10 years this increased to 13.6 percent. Despite this increase, Czechia falls short of many other European Union nations in its adoption of renewable energy. Just six other nations had less renewable energy shares in 2016.
