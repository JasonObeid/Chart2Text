 The most valuable brand in 2019 in the United Kingdom was, by some distance, the British-Dutch oil and gas company Shell. Interestingly, Shell was the only brand in the top ten with headquarters outside of the UK, and the only one in the top 25 most valuable companies worldwide in 2019. The second most valuable brand was the professional services firm EY (Ernst & Young), followed in third place by another oil and gas company, BP. Telecommunications brands making waves Although two of the top three most valuable brands in the UK are oil and gas companies, it’s the telecommunications branch which is most represented. Vodafone, Sky, and BT all made the top ten, with 3 and O2 both just missing out. Banking on brand value Two bank brands made the top ten, HSBC and Barclays. When it comes to brand value, these two have been a cut above the rest for the last few years, with HSBC seeing an increase in brand value in 2019 compared to the previous year. Supermarket giant Tesco was the seventh most valuable brand. Land Rover was the only brand from the automotive sector, although they weren’t considered one of the most valuable automotive brands worldwide.
