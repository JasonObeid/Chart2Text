 This statistic shows the total sales value of tea in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2015, split by category. At that time, black tea was worth 450.7 million British pounds in the UK, followed by fruit and herbal teas at 78.7 million British pounds. A majority of British consumers drink tea on a daily basis, with earlier times in the day the peak period for tea drinking. Tea can be drank with milk as 'white' or without as 'black', of which both methods are almost equally popular. Levels of consumption, however, are on the decline as the United Kingdom moves closer to becoming a nation of coffee drinkers rather than tea drinkers, as seen in the rising value of the market for hot drinks. Other tea types, such as fruit and herbal teas, are also gaining ground as consumers seek the health and wellness benefits of such products.
