 Deliveries of BMW MINI-badged cars stood at about 361,500 units in 2018. BMW has operated the MINI brand since 2000 and adapted the trademark compact style originally designed by Birmingham-based British Motor Corporation (BMC) to meet modern preferences. In the UK, the MINI brand was launched with great success. MINI has a UK car registration share of about three percent and accounts for almost 30 percent of BMW Group’s vehicle sales in the United Kingdom. Origin of MINI The MINI brand was originally a small two-door hatchback that became synonymous with 1960s British style and motoring. The MINI was even developed as a successful rally car, with its compact and low center of gravity design able to accelerate around tight corners. MINI's place as a cultural icon was set in stone as it featured in a 1969 caper film, The Italian Job. Design changes The United States has become one of MIN’s largest markets. In light of MINI's dwindling U.S. market share, however, BMW intends to implement major changes to designs and marketing strategies to suit the U.S. market. Unlike its smaller predecessors, the MINI Countryman was the first subcompact crossover SUV for the brand. Future MINIs are expected to go in similar directions. BMW are also expected to produce a fully electric model to compete in the growing electric vehicle market.
