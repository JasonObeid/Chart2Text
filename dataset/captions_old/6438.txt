 This statistic shows the distribution of first languages, other than English or Welsh, spoken in England and Wales in 2011 at the time of the National Census, by language group. EU European languages were the most commonly spoken, possibly due to the proximity of their countries, but also due to the freedom of movement within the European Union. 2.4 percent of the total population spoke a South Asian language as their first language. This category included Indian languages such as Panjabi, Urdu, Bengali, which were the third, fourth and fifth most common foreign first languages in England and Wales.
