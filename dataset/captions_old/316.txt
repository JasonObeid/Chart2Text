 Since it was first launched in 2004, Facebook has developed from a humble social media page to a global phenomenon. The site can be used for catching up with friends, advertising businesses, and passing the time with games. The two most popular games on the social media site are 8 Ball Pool and Candy Crush Saga, both of which boasted 10 million daily active users in 2019. Candy Crush’s sweet success Developed by King, Candy Crush Saga is a puzzle video game in which players swap different types of candy on a game board in order to match three or more of the same type. The game was first released on Facebook in 2012 and has since become available on most mobile operating systems and on browser. Although the game is free-to-play, users have the choice of purchasing power-ups in order to help them get past particularly tricky levels. The original Candy Crush Saga generated revenue of 945 million U.S. dollars worldwide in 2018, while the newest release, Candy Crush Friends Saga, generated a further three million U.S. dollars. Unsurprisingly, King has seen its revenue skyrocket after the global success of Candy Crush – the comparatively humble revenue of 58.5 million U.S. dollars in 2010 soared to over two billion U.S. dollars by 2018. King vs. Zynga One of King’s biggest rivals in the social gaming world is Zynga. The company’s best-known game is FarmVille, an agricultural simulation game which launched in 2009. Its sequel, FarmVille 2, was launched in 2012 and can still be found on the list of the most popular Facebook games based on number of daily active users. Zynga’s revenue stood at 907 million U.S. dollars in 2018. The popularity of FarmVille can be seen by the fact that the company’s revenue peaked in 2012, the year that the game was released.
