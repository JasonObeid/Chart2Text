November and December of the same year recorded the highest levels of monthly rainfall after January, at 122.6 and 119.5 mm respectively. Regional weather Due to the United Kingdom’s geographical location and landscape, weather conditions can vary greatly. Scotland has on average been the wettest country since 2010. The majority of rainfall is concentrated in the Scottish Highlands, as precipitation often occurs in mountainous regions. As rainfall comes in from the Atlantic, it is the northern and western parts of the UK that are most susceptible to precipitation. This explains why England is the driest of all the regions, as rain deposits reduce as they move east.
