 According to a 2019 survey of more than 4,000 UK residents, 80 percent had some concern about climate change. In comparison, 18 percent were not concerned, with 5 percent of those having no concerns at all. The survey was conducted by the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) as part of its Energy and Climate Public Attitudes Tracker. Climate change causes In the same BEIS survey, it was found that 33 percent of respondents believed climate change is mainly caused by human activity. 15 percent believed it is caused entirely by human activity, whilst 2 percent felt that there is no such thing as climate change. Climate change is the term used for global weather phenomena which results in new weather patterns, increasing global temperatures. This term also includes the climate effects these increasing temperatures cause. A move towards green energy A 2018 YouGov poll found that 71 percent of respondents felt the UK government should put greater investment in renewable energy to limit climate change. Since the turn of the century, the share of electricity generation from renewable sources has increased significantly, and by 2017 amounted to approximately 30 percent. In this same period the UK has seen its greenhouse gas and carbon dioxide emissions decrease from 707.5 to 460.2 MtCO2e and 558.3 to 373.2 MtCO2e respectively.
