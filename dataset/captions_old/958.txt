 The countries with the highest prevalence of multiple sclerosis include Canada, San Marino, Denmark, and Sweden. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects communication in parts of the nervous system and damages the brain and spinal cord. Some of those with MS eventually become disabled due to the disease, but many can still walk, if not with the aid of a cane or crutches. Symptoms Symptoms of MS frequently affect movement, and can cause vision problems, slurred speech, fatigue, and trouble with coordination. Symptoms can vary greatly from person to person and people with MS may experience periods where symptoms improve partially or completely and then relapse. The most common symptoms that keep those with MS from working include fatigue, difficulty walking, standing and moving around, weakness, and cognitive impairment. Impact of MS Multiple sclerosis can impact the lives of those living with the disease in many ways. A survey from 2018 of people suffering from MS found that 24 percent stated they had chosen to stop working due to the disease, while 13 percent lost their job and 12 percent had to take medical leave. MS can also impact the personal and intimate lives of those who suffer. The same survey found 38 percent of respondents said fatigue from MS negatively impacted their sex life.
