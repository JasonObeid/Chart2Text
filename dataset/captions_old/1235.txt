 In 2018, the infant mortality rate in the United States was 5.6 out of every 1,000 births. This is a significant decrease from 1990, when infant mortality was at 9.4 deaths out of every 1,000s births. What is Infant Mortality? The infant mortality rate is the number of deaths of babies under the age of one per 1,000 live births. There are many causes for infant mortality, which include birth defects, low birth weight, pregnancy complications, and sudden infant death syndrome. In order to decrease the high rates of infant mortality, there needs to be an increase in education and medicine so babies and mothers can receive the proper treatment needed. Maternal mortality is also related to infant mortality. If mothers can attend more prenatal visits and have more access to healthcare facilities, maternal mortality can decrease, and babies have a better chance of surviving in their first year. Worldwide Infant Mortality Rates Infant mortality rates vary worldwide; however, some areas are more affected than others. Afghanistan suffered from the highest infant mortality rate in 2017, and the following 19 countries all came from Africa. On the other hand, Monaco had the lowest infant mortality rate that year. High infant mortality rates can be attributed to lack of sanitation, technological advancements, and proper natal care. In the United States, New Hampshire had the lowest infant mortality rate while Mississippi had the highest in 2018. Overall, the number of neonatal and post neonatal deaths in the United States has been steadily decreasing since 1995.
