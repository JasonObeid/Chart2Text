Salmonellosis, an infection caused by Salmonella, usually lasts between 4 to 7 days and generally patients recover without any treatment. Salmonella can be transferred from animal products to humans so the best preventative measures are to cook food such as poultry, ground beef, and eggs thoroughly. Cross-contamination of these food items should also be avoided. In very young and elderly patients, the bacteria may enter the bloodstream and require antibiotherapy to cure the patient. Salmonella can also lead to other illnesses such as typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever, and food poisoning. About 67.9 million U.S. dollars were donated for research and development on the Salmonella infection globally in 2015.
