 Real Madrid are by far the most successful team in European Cup history, having taken home the prestigious trophy a total of 13 times. Los Blancos’ closest rivals in terms of titles are AC Milan, who have won the Champions League seven times, most recently in 2007 against Liverpool. Real Madrid’s European dominanceReal Madrid have dominated the Champions League in recent years and took home the trophy four out of five times between 2013 and 2018. Their only failure came during the 2015 season when they were knocked out by Juventus in the semi-finals, with bitter rivals Barcelona ultimately lifting the trophy. Having won the trophy in 2018, there were high hopes for the reigning champions in 2019. However, the European giants were knocked out by underdogs, Ajax, in the quarter final stage of the competition, marking their earliest exit from Europe for nine years. The Champions League is big businessThe total revenue of the UEFA Champions League amounted to over 2.1 billion euros in the 2017/18, a significant jump from the revenue of just under 1.1 billion euros in the 2009/10 season. With the club competition being one of the most popular in the world, the rights to broadcast the games are unsurprisingly worth a lot of money. In the 2017/18 season, the competition generated revenue of over 1.71 billion euros in broadcasting rights and a further 390 million euros in commercial rights. While soccer still has a long way to go to reach the popularity of traditional sports such as American Football and basketball in the United States, it appears that interest in the sport is starting to grow. A total of two million U.S. viewers tuned into the Champions League final in 2018, an increase from 1.68 million in 2016.
