 2,254 murderers in the United States in 2018 were individuals between the ages of 20 and 24. In the same year, the youngest murder offender was between the ages of one and four, and there were 93 murder offenders over the age of 75. Murder rate in the United States Despite some feeling that violent crime in the United States is on the rise, perhaps due to sensationalized media coverage, the murder and nonnegligent manslaughter rate has declined steeply since 1990. The murder rate has risen some since 2014, but it is nowhere near its peak in 1991. Murder victims in the U.S. The figures for the number of murder victims were similar to those of offenders in 2018. In that year, 2,199 murder victims were between the ages of 20 and 24, although the total number of victims was much higher than the number of offenders. The vast majority of murders in the U.S. were committed with firearms, including handguns, rifles, shotguns, and other unidentified guns or firearms. This is generally attributed to the high rate of gun ownership in the United States, which makes guns more accessible than in other countries.
