 This statistic shows the total global production of lead metal from 2006 to 2018. Lead metal production In 2018, some 11.6 million metric tons of lead metal was produced globally. The base metal is usually extracted in combination with zinc, silver and copper. BHP Billiton, Glencore Xstrata, the Doe Run Company and Teck are counted among the largest lead mining companies worldwide. The major lead producing countries include China, Australia, the United States and Mexico. Batteries account for about 80 percent of worldwide lead consumption, and over two-thirds of the minor metal end up in car batteries. Other uses include the manufacture of paints and pigments and other chemical compounds. The growing production of electric cars and bicycles is likely to boost demand for lead over the next couple of years, with China presumably accounting for most of the growth. While lithium-ion batteries are expected to replace lead-acid batteries in the long run, Chinese demand for lead-based batteries remains strong. China’s lead production in 2017 accounted for 48.8 percent of the world's total. Global lead use 11.6 million metric tons in 2018, up from around 10 million metric tons in 2012, roughly a 9.5 percent increase over the five-year period. According to the London Metals Exchange, lead will steadily rise to reach 0.9 U.S. dollar cents per pound in 2020.
