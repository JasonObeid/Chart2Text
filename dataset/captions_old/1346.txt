 In 2019, the music album with the most unit sales in the United States was 'Lover' by Taylor Swift, far outperforming all other records in the list with almost 1.1 million copies sold that year.

The three artists also featured in the list of top-selling music albums based on total streams. Other well-known artists like Harry Styles, BTS, and the the Backstreet Boys made the top ten, selling between 300 and more than 450 thousand albums each in 2019.

The album marked the rock band's first release since 2006, and received widespread critical acclaim upon its release and performed well in the charts in its opening week. Songs 'Fear Inoculum' and '7empest' were both nominated for Grammys in 2019, the latter of which had a runtime of more than 15 minutes, making it the longest track on the album.
