 During this period the overall price of electricity for households in Sweden increased. From a low of 18.39 euro cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) in the first half of 2010, prices reached 20.15 euro cents at the beginning of 2019. Prices peaked in the first half of 2013 at 21 euro cents. Households with an annual consumption of 2,500 to 5,000 kWh paid 19.65 euro cents per kWh in 2017. In comparison, those with a consumption of up to 2,499 kWh paid 22.12 euro cents. European comparisons In 2018, Swedish households enjoyed relatively low prices when compared with the rest of Europe, especially Nordic neighbor Denmark. Prices there were more than 10 U.S cents more expensive per kilowatt-hour than in Sweden. Renewable energy’s impact on prices Sweden’s comparatively low electricity prices are down to several factors, such as a decrease in final electricity demand and increased generation from renewable sources such as solar power and wind power. Both renewable sources have seen production increase significantly in recent years, with solar production reaching 400 gigawatt-hours in 2018, compared to 21.4 in 2012.
