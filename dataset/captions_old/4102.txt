 The apparel and footwear market in the UK is a robust one, expected to reach a value of 66 billion euros according to estimates made by Euromonitor. Indeed, over the years consumers in UK households spent more and more on clothing and footwear purchases, with expenditure marking over 70 million British pounds, as displayed in the present statistic. Online share of clothing and footwear sales While spending on apparel holds steady, the number of stores for clothing and footwear in the UK has dropped in recent years. The likeliest culprit for this trend is online, which currently stands for 18.7 percent of all retail sales made in textile, clothing and footwear stores in Great Britain. Primark inches its way to the top The UK apparel market is dominated by the country’s most established retailers such as Marks and Spencer. As of 2018, M&S still enjoys the highest share in the market at 9 percent. Yet having made great strides since 2008, it is not unlikely that the fast fashion company Primark will closely challenge M&S’s leading position in the coming years.
