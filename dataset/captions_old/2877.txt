 As of June 2017, approximately 23 kilometers of highway construction was done across India. The total length of national highways across the south Asian country was over 120 thousand kilometers in 2017. There are over 200 national highways in the nation which control about 40 percent of the road traffic. The highways, however, make up a share of less than two percent of all Indian roads. The National Highway Authority of India is responsible for the maintenance and new construction of the country’s highway network. Longest roads Budget allocation for highway development across the country had increased steadily over the recent years. There were around 87 national highways in the country. During fiscal year 2018, the longest highways were constructed in the south-western state of Maharashtra measuring about 1,350 kilometers. The lengthiest highway in the country, at over 3.7 thousand kilometers was NH-44, connecting Srinagar in the north and Kanyakumari in the south. Safety on the highway Road safety in India had been a challenge for the government. In 2017, over 470 thousand people were injured in road accidents. National highways contributed a share of around 30 percent in the total road accidents (747989). Nonetheless, highway development has helped in the development of the Indian economy. Faster and better connections between cities and villages have made commute efficient and comfortable in many situations and created many opportunities for people to travel for work or for leisure.
