Danish surnames Most surnames in Denmark were created by using the patronymic tradition until hereditary surnames became mandatory in the 1820s. This was a common tradition in some of the Nordic countries. For Danish surnames, it meant to have the suffix -sen (son) or -datter (daughter) added to the father’s name. Due to the German influence, other names occurred for example from an occupation such as Møller (the operator of the mill), which was a common tradition for creating surnames in Germany.
