 In 2018, natural gas accounted for 45 percent of the total electricity production in Italy. Among renewable sources, hydropower ranked first, covering 16 percent of the total production, followed by biomass and solar energy. Nowadays, climate change seems to be one of the most challenging issues that national governments should be tackling. Energy transition is imperative and yet considering how static the energy sector can be, it is easy to foresee a long way ahead before reaching a complete replacement of fossil fuels with renewable sources. Natural gas leading the energy transition in Italy The central role of natural gas and renewables in the Italian energy strategy can be also confirmed by looking back to the past few years. However, the share of production covered by renewable energy sources (RES) slightly decreased over time, while the percentage of electricity generated from natural gas kept on growing. As a matter of fact, the gross amount of energy produced from natural gas steadily increased between 2014 and 2017, and it nearly quadrupled compared to 1990. The potential of photovoltaic energy Scarce rainfall is to blame for the decrease registered in the electricity production from renewables between 2016 and 2017. As hydropower is the dominant renewable source of energy in the country due to infrastructural reasons, the waning in hydroelectric production has clearly affected the level of energy generation from RES. On the other hand, PV technology still played a crucial part in 2018, in terms of installed capacity and electricity production and it is expected to overtake hydropower by the end of 2030 .
