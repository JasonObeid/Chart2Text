 The FIFA World Cup is not only one of the biggest prizes in sport, it also boasts a big prize pot. The total prize money for the 2018 World Cup in Russia stood at 791 million U.S. dollars, a significant increase on the 576 million U.S. dollars up for grabs at the previous World Cup in Brazil in 2014. France take home the big prize Thanks to their success at the 2018 World Cup, France not only took home the coveted trophy, but also bagged a record 35 million U.S. dollars in prize money. The 25 million U.S. dollars handed out to the runners-up, Croatia, would have been little consolation to losing out on the biggest trophy in international soccer. Even the teams that were knocked out in the group stages of the 2018 World Cup, which included the likes of Serbia, Germany, and Australia, were given eight million U.S. dollars as consolation. Big talent = Big moneyAt the World Cup, the big money is not just limited to the prize money but is also evident in the squads themselves. Given the fact that they came out on top in the 2018 World Cup, it is unsurprising that France boasted the squad with the highest transfer value. On the other end of the spectrum, minnows Panama, with a combined market value of just over nine million euros, were not able to shake off their underdog status as they lost every game in their group. According to their market value, Lionel Messi of Argentina and Neymar of Brazil were the two biggest stars at the 2018 World Cup. However, they were unable to lead their teams to glory as Argentina were knocked out by eventual champions, France, in the round of 16 and Brazil fell victim to Belgium in the quarter-finals.
