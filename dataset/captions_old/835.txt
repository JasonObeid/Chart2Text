Once a successful phone manufacturer in the early 2000s, the company struggled with increasingly overwhelming competition from Apple and Samsung. One reason for Nokia’s declining share within the mobile phone market was remaining committed to their own mobile operating system Symbian (OS) for too long before switching to Google’s Android OS.
