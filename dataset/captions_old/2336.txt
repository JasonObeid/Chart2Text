 This statistic shows the number of households in Belgium in 2019, by type. In 2019 approximately five million private households were counted in Belgium, of which approximately 35 percent or 1.7 million were single-person households. Approximately one million households consisted of married couples with children living at home, whereas another 951,000 married couples had no children living at home. Relatively few households consisted of unmarried couples without children living at home. As this statistic shows, the number of households in Belgium is constantly increasing, from 4.7 million in 2011 to nearly five million according to the most recent numbers. This number is therefore expected to slowly increase further in the near future, with ever more single-person households forming in Belgium. Because of the ageing population, the number of collective households could also increase in the future.
