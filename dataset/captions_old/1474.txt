 Avengers: Endgame was all-time highest grossing Hollywood movie in India as of September 2019. The top ten movies include genres that are loaded with action or are animated, similar to the trend in domestic movies. A dramatic consistency With an industry estimated to be valued at nearly 229 billion rupees by 2023, it comes as no surprise that India’s film industry produced the largest number of movies. A film’s success is measured by the return on its investment and its performance at the box office. Historically, the mainstream Indian films that have been immensely successful are high in drama, action and have a popular actor or actress. Indians arguably look for similar characteristics in Hollywood, even though box office revenue is much lower for international-language films when compared to domestic movies. Change is on the horizon< Despite the success of the tried and tested plot formula (man meets woman, followed by villain-created trouble, resulting in a woman-rescue mission reiterating the man as a hero), the Indian audience is slowly but surely moving away from the mainstream. Recent years have given rise for the telling of unconventional stories, sometimes with a female lead. This is a seemingly bold but brave change for the traditional Indian to adapt to. This kind of filmmaking has been trending in recent years - from increasing in funding all the way to being shown in theaters. The success of films like Dangal, Padmaavat, Badhaai Ho and Raazi among Hindi films support the changing landscape of the Indian film industry. It’s safe to assume this transition will be seen in the consumption of Hollywood movies within the country in the future.
