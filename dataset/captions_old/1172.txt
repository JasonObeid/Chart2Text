 In 2018, India was the second largest producer of cement in the world. The country had about eight percent of the global installed capacity that year. Consumption of cement at this time stood at around 270 million metric tons. The market has been dominated by the private sector, having about 98 percent of the total production capacity. Demand for cement was estimated to increase in the coming years. This meant an increase in the installed production capacity as well. Housing and real estate were the major consumers of the material in 2019, accounting for over 60 percent of the domestic demand. Infrastructure in India One of the key drivers for the Indian economy was infrastructure. In 2019, this sector had an FDI equity inflow of around 2.26 billion U.S. dollars. With over 90 merger and acquisition deals in 2017, investments in the industry were estimated to continue. Concrete future In 2014, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the ‘Make in India’ initiative to transform the country into a global manufacturing hub. The initiative encouraged both international, as well as domestic companies to manufacture their products within India. With new reforms, and the possibility of 100 percent FDI in various sectors, infrastructure in India is likely to continue being a major growth contributor.
