Another coffee price index, for example, ranked the high-income Switzerland and Nordic countries as having the highest prices for a cappuccino in European restaurants. The coffeehouse landscape also varies by country, with the presence of coffee chains high in some markets, while other independent cafés are the more prominent choice for local coffee consumption.
