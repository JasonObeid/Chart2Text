 This time series shows the year-on-year revenue growth rate in the semiconductor industry from 1988 to 2018, and forecasted growth rates to 2020. In 2020, the semiconductor industry is predicted to grow by 5.9 percent compared to the previous year. Semiconductors are crucial components of electronics devices. Due to their ability to conduct electricity under some circumstances but not others, they are useful for controlling electrical currents. By adding impurities to a semiconductor, manufacturers are able to customize its conductivity, such as by making it light- or heat-sensitive.
