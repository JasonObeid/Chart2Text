 This statistic shows the monthly amount of cars sold by MG in the United Kingdom (UK) between July 2014 and December 2019. Peaks in registration numbers were recorded in March and September of each year, which was due to the issuing of license plates by the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in those months. From 2018 onward, MG monthly sales volume generally increased in comparison to the previous years. In December 2019, 1,700 new units had been sold, an increase of roughly 162 percent in comparison to the same month a year beforehand.
