 Does it always rain in Belgium? Well, there is some truth in each stereotype! Although it certainly does not rain every day, there is a lot of rainfall in Belgium. In 2016, it rained 190 out of 366 days, or over half of the days. And this was by no means a record: in 2012, it rained 212 days, or nearly 60 percent of all days. That year, the rainfall was nearly 1,000 millimeters. In 2016, although there were fewer rain days, rainfall was still over 940 millimeters. Fortunately the sun sometimes shines too Having read this, one might be forgiven for thinking the climate in Belgium is rather bad. Fortunately, Belgians have ample time to enjoy the sun as well. In 2016 for example, there were nearly 1,600 hours of sunshine. This was significantly more than in 2007 and 2008 for instance, when there were less than 1,500 hours. In recent years, 2011 was the sunniest year, with almost 1,800 hours of sunshine. Average temperature around 10 degrees Celsius All year round, the average temperature in Belgium is around 10 degrees Celsius in the last decade. In 2016, the average reached 10.7 degrees, a slight decrease compared to the two previous years, when the average temperature was 11.9 (2014) and 11.3 (2015) respectively.
