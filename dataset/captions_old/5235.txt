 This statistic shows the monthly amount of cars sold by Citroen in the United Kingdom (UK) between July 2014 and December 2019. Peaks in registration numbers were recorded in March and September of each year, which was due to the issuing of license plates by the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in those months. In December 2019, Citroen sold 2,901 cars in the UK, an increase of over 44 percent compared with December 2018.
