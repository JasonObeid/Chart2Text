 The Irish low-cost carrier Ryanair saw an astonishing growth in the amount of net profits generated, before suffering a roughly 39 percent decline in its latest financial year. Between 2012/13 and 2017/18, the Dublin based company was able to nearly triple their net profits. In 2017/18, this figure reached 1.45 billion euros, roughly 10 million euros lower than its peak in 2015/16, before dropping to 885 million euros in 2018/19.Ryanair was established in 1984 and heavily profited from the European Union’s deregulation of the air industry in 1998, allowing it to operate air travel between other EU member states. Why the fall in profits? With its generally affordable ticket prices, Ryanair’s increase in profitability observed until 2017/18, was mainly due to a growing number of passengers choosing to travel with the airline. However, the company states that higher oil prices as well as greater payroll costs, extended strikes by air traffic control and staff shortage resulted in the prominent decline of net profits seen in 2018/19. Commercial airline profits Net profits of worldwide commercial airlines were at an all time high in 2017. Despite a decline for 2019, figures were still significantly greater than those reported at the beginning of the decade. However, airlines operating in Europe were set to see a more pronounced decline in profits compared to those from other regions.
