 This statistic shows the results of a survey among American pet owners on the amount of money they estimate to spend per annum on their pet. The survey was conducted in 2015, and is sorted by type of purchase/reason for spending money. The estimated amount spent on food treats for pets thus adds up to an estimated mean amount of approximately 477 U.S. dollars per year.
