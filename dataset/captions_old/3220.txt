Reinsurers Reinsurance is a type of insurance that other insurance companies take out to reduce risk. Essentially, it works to restrict the amount of money an insurer can possibly lose and, in turn, protects their own customers from losses. There are two procedures for reinsurance, facultative and treaty. Facultative reinsurance is when an insurance company buys insurance for a specific instance or occurrence. Treaty reinsurance covers a set of predetermined risks over a period of time. Facultative is seen as a one-time deal whereas treaty reinsurance is long term. There are several types of reinsurance which include proportional, non-proportional, risk attaching basis, losses occurring basis, and a claims-made basis. The proportional structure of reinsurance means that the reinsurer will handle a part of the losses, in which it gets a prorated share of the insurer’s premiums. The non-proportional reinsurance structure means the agreement will start when the insurer’s losses surpass a certain amount.
