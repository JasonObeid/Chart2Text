 British oil and gas equipment company TechnipFMC generated a revenue of 12.6 billion U.S. dollars in 2018. The origin story TechnipFMC emerged as the result of a merger in 2017 between the American company, FMC Technologies Inc. (founded in 2001), and the French company, Technip SA (founded in 1958). Headquartered in Houston, Paris, and London, TechnipFMC has grown to become one of the leading companies in the global oil and gas equipment and services technology sector. TechnipFMC is comprised of three segments: subsea, offshore, onshore and surface projects. Operating in 48 countries, TechnipFMC offers many services such as offshore oil exploration, oil extraction, and crude oil refinery. Within the United States, they have three operating centers which are devoted to the development of onshore process technologies. Company figures Since the merger, TechnipFMC’s number of employees has been on average 40,000 people. The company’s net income from 2017 to 2018 plummeted dramatically, down to a staggering net loss of 1.9 billion U.S. dollars in 2018 . Their total assets also decreased in value, though not nearly as dramatically.
