 Based on a ranking on the prize money earned by the leading eSporters in Fortnite from the Netherlands, 21-year-old Rojo (the gamer tag of Dave Jong) outperformed all other eSporters. This because of his second place on the Fortnite World Cup in July 2019, which won him one million U.S. dollars. Most of the popularity of the Battle Royale game stems from online game streams. In 2017, 36 percent of Dutch game stream watchers used Twitch. Is Fortnite big in Dutch eSports? Over the whole of 2018, Fortnite players as Dmitri “Mitr0” van de Vrie, Sven “Svennos” Edelenbosch and Milan “Milan” Lopes also topped the overall prize money ranking for Dutch eSporters. There was no entry for Dave "Rojo" Jong then, as the player was not yet involved in competitive play. During this time, the video game rapidly grew in popularity in the Netherlands as can be seen in the net revenue reached by its mobile version in 2018 and 2019. How about Fornite’s competitors in the Netherlands? Fortnite and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds or PUBG received much global media attention in 2018 due to their high popularity. Both games were the first Battle Royale games, a genre of video games where up to 100 players are pitted against each other in a fight for survival until only one player is left standing. In 2019, Apex Legends joined these two as a Battle Royale only game (other video game series implemented a Battle Royale mode). For the latter, no data is available yet in the Netherlands. For PUBG, it seems that only a few Dutch eSporters were active in this game. This might have to do with both Fortnite’s free-to-play model (players pay for cosmetics, but the game itself is free) as well as the more competitive nature of PUBG.
