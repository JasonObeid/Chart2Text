 PetSmart, formerly known as PetFood Warehouse, is an American retail chain which focuses on the sale of pet products as well as services, such as grooming and training. PetSmart was the leading pet retailer in the United States in 2019 in terms of market share. Their revenue reached approximately 6.49 billion U.S. dollars in the United States in the 2018/19 fiscal year ending on January 31. Revenue streams PetSmart brings revenue in from brick-and-mortar stores across the U.S. as well as in Canada and Puerto Rico. PetSmart also offers their customers the option to shop online and have products delivered directly to their doors. The majority of both cat and dog owners still purchase all of their pet food in-store rather than online. However, with the evolution of the e-commerce market in the U.S., it is likely that more consumers will turn to online channels for pet purchases in the future. The competitive landscape The pet store industry continues to grow despite increased competition from supermarkets and mass merchandisers which offer shoppers more convenience at lower prices. When it comes to competition within the pet retailer market, PETCO Animal Supplies Inc is PetSmart’s major rival. PETCO have 1,482 stores across North America, and their revenue has been steadily climbing in the past few years to contend with PetSmart.
