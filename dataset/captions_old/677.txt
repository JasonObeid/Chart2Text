 The global tea market was valued at over 52 billion U.S. dollars in 2018, and is expected to rise to over 81 billion dollars by 2026. Tea has a long history of popularity worldwide. It is thought to have originated in China, with records of its use dating back to the 3rd century AD. Originally used as a medicinal beverage, the drink was popularized for recreational use during the Tang dynasty and spread to other Asian countries. After European traders brought the leaves back to Europe in the 16th century its popularity spread in the West as well. Production Today, China is still the leader in tea production. The country produced over 2.5 million metric tons of it in 2017. Other large producers are India and Kenya. These regions are hospitable to Camellia sinensis, the plant used to produce tea, which needs a tropical or subtropical climate. Consumption While Pakistan is the biggest importer of tea worldwide, buying over a half billion dollars’ worth in 2017, it is the citizens of Turkey who are most fond of the beverage. In 2016, the average Turkish person consumed nearly seven pounds of tea during the year.
