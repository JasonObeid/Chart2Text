How many people play PUBG? PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG), which is available on console and PC, crossed the 50 million player base mark in June 2018 - an impressive figure considering it was released little over a year earlier. The Battle Royale game developed by Bluehole was made available to the public in March 2017. One of the biggest games on Steam While it is available on both PlayStation and Xbox One, PUBG’s origins lie in PC and, more specifically, on Steam. The game originally became available on Steam Early Access in late March 2017 and quickly gained a loyal legion of fans. As a result, PUBG remains one of the most successful games on the PC gaming platform, even though over 9,000 games were released on Steam in 2018 alone. Considering the size of each battle in PUBG, with up to 100 players pitted against each other in a fight for supremacy, it is unsurprising that the game topped the 2018 list for peak number of concurrent players on Steam. The game reached more than 3.2 million players in a single hour in its peak, far surpassing its closest rival, DOTA 2. PUBG mobile In order to tap into the increasingly dominant mobile gaming market, PUBG was released as a mobile game in early 2018. Despite the fast-paced world of mobile gaming, some 42.3 percent of Android users in the United States who owned PUBG mobile still played the game monthly as of February 2019, although only one fifth stated that they still played it daily. Given the nature of the game and the gaming world in general, it is unsurprising that male users accounted for 57.4 percent of the gaming app's active user accounts on the Android platform. However, with over half of those who own the game on Android claiming to be inactive users, PUBG might need to take action to keep hold of its loyal fans in the face of competition from rivals such as Fortnite and Apex Legends.
