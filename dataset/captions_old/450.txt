 This statistic shows the distribution of France public budget breakdown by spending area in 2019 in million euros. In 2019, the French government decided to spend roughly 72 billion euros for education, 44.3 billion euros for defense and 20.1 billion euros for security, yet the largest share of governmental spending in France was repaid back to the tax payers of France. Since 2012, the tax revenue in France has been increasing, mostly because of the value-added tax (VAT). The revenue from VAT amounted to 157 billion euros in 2017, compared to 137 billion euros in 2012. It appears that the level of taxes in France is increasing for a few years now. On the other hand, the country keeps having a rather high debt level. In 2018, the public debt in France reached 96.8 percent of the GDP.
