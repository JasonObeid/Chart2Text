 Between 2006 and 2018, road fatalities in Sweden had seen a net decline of 27 percent. The lowest figure of such fatalities was recorded in 2017 at 253. These figures stand in contrast to an increase in the volume of passenger road transport. In 2017, people travelled a combined 126.7 billion kilometers, which was 10 billion kilometers more than in 2006. Casualty figures also in decline Much like road fatalities, the number of road traffic casualties declined over the past decade. A total of roughly 19,700 individuals had reportedly been injured in 2017, with figures 26 percent lower than eleven years prior. This was despite a slight increase in the past three years.
