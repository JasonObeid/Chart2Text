 The national team of Brazil has won the most soccer World Cup titles of all time with five, winning the tournament in 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994 and, most recently, in 2002. Didier Deschamps’ double success The most recent World Cup, which was hosted by Russia in 2018, was won by France. The team, coached by Didier Deschamps, won the final 4-2 against Croatia. This marked a double success for the national team coach as he was part of the France squad that won the country’s first ever World Cup in 1998. The 2018 victory for France was not a complete surprise as the French squad boasted the highest market value of all the teams at the World Cup, with a total value of around 1.08 billion euros. Brazil’s dominance beginning to fade? Despite being the most successful nation in the history of the World Cup, Brazil’s national team has struggled in recent tournaments. Despite the team being full of superstars such as Neymar and Philippe Coutinho, the Brazilians were knocked out by Belgium in the quarter-finals in 2018. There were high hopes for the Brazilian team at their home World Cup in 2014 and they seemed destined for glory as they made their way through to the semi-finals. However, in one of the most memorable games in World Cup history, the home team were unceremoniously dumped out by the Germans, who beat them 7-1, before going on to claim the trophy against France in the final. This tournament marked the end of a glittering World Cup career for Germany’s Miroslav Klose, who is the all-time leading goal scorer at the World Cup. He scored his sixteenth and record-breaking goal in Germany's semi-final matchup with Brazil at the 2014 World Cup.
