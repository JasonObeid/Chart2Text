 The graph shows the population growth in China from 2000 to 2017. In 2017, annual population growth in China amounted to about 0.6 percent. Declining population growth in China Due to strict birth control measures by the Chinese government as well as changing family and work situations of the Chinese people, population growth has subsided over the past decades. In the last ten years, the annual population growth ranged at around 0.5 percent, although the gradual abolition of the one-child policy from 2014 on led to temporarily higher birth figures. As of 2017, leading countries in population growth could almost exclusively be found on the African continent and the Arabian Peninsula. Nevertheless, as of mid 2018, Asia ranked first by a wide margin among the continents in terms of absolute population. Future development of Chinese populationThe Chinese population will soon reach a maximum size and then begin to shrink gradually. However, the exact year for this turning point is unclear. Whereas IMF estimates see it coming in the first half of the 2020s, Chinese demographers expect a later date around 2030. As of 2018, China still ranked the world’s most populous country, but India followed closely and will soon take over. Apart from the receding population growth, a clear growth trend in Chinese cities is visible. By 2018, nearly 60 percent of Chinese people lived in urban areas, compared to less than 40 percent in 2002.
