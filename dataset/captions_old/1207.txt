While the 1990's and early 2000's saw a big rise in brew pubs, the trend today leans more toward microbreweries that aim to distribute their product. Over the last couple of years, the number of new brewery openings has been at near unprecedented levels; the highest total since the 1880's. And every year, hundreds more are opening. In 2016, the craft brewing industry provided more than 128 thousand jobs across the country.The innovative nature of these craft brewers has driven the market.

Brewers will also focus their marketing efforts on capturing the expanding consumer base represented by female consumers.
