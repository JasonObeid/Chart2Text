 The statistic represents global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions between 1975 and 2019. Globally, 17.78 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide was emitted in relation to energy in 1980. Energy-related emissions stabilized in 2019 when emissions reached 33.3 billion metric tons, following two consecutive years of increases in greenhouse gas emissions. Global carbon dioxide emissions – additional informationIn 2016, carbon dioxide emissions from fuel combustion totaled some 32.3 billion metric tons. The volume of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions has steadily risen over the last decade, from 28.7 billion metric tons in 2009 to 33.3 billion metric tons in 2019. However, the rate of increase has slowed down in the last few years, but has still reached a historic high in the last year. From 2013 to 2016, there had been evidence of a global decoupling of greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth. It has been suggested that the immense addition of new renewable energy capacity has been critical for reducing emissions growth. In the recent past, a decrease or relatively unchanged volume of emissions has only been seen during economically weak periods, such as during the 2009 recession. Both the United States and China, two of the largest emitters in the world, registered a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions in 2015. In China, a reduction in coal consumption has enabled an economic restructuring towards less energy-intensive industries and an emphasis on renewable resources. However, the decrease in emissions from these two countries was largely offset by other developing Asian countries and the Middle East, as well as increased emissions in Europe. Carbon dioxide emissions worldwide were primarily emitted by the Asia Pacific region, which reported more emissions in 2018 than North America (6.04 billion metric tons) and Europe (4.21 billion metric tons) combined.
