 After almost dropping below 70 percent in 2011, the annual employment rate in the United Kingdom started to climb at a relatively fast pace, reaching 76. 2 per cent in 2019. The first quarterly data available for 2019 showed that this positive trend has continued, with the employment rate reaching 76.1 percent, the highest it has been since records began in 1971. Over 31 million workers in 2018 The high employment rate has resulted in record levels of employed people in the United Kingdom, at approximately 31.2 million in 2018. In comparison with 2014 when there has been a net increase of over 1 million people in employment. Despite the ambiguity surrounding the Brexit process, it appears many British businesses are continuing to hire and invest in their workforce. Still over a million unemployed Although the number of unemployed people has fallen in recent years, there were still around 1.3 million without jobs as of March 2019. For the whole country this amounts to an unemployment rate of 3.8 percent, with the North East of England and the West Midlands having the worst regional unemployment rates at 5.4 and 5.1 percent respectively.
