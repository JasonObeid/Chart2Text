 The typical American picture of a family with 2.5 kids might not be as relevant as it once was: In 2019, there was an average of 1.93 children under 18 per family in the United States. This is a decrease from 2.33 children under 18 per family in 1960. Familial structure in the United States If there’s one thing the United States is known for, it’s diversity. Whether this is diversity in ethnicity, culture, or family structure, there is something for everyone in the U.S. Two-parent households in the U.S. are declining, and the number of families with no children are increasing. The number of families with children has stayed more or less constant since 2000. Adoptions in the U.S. Families in the U.S. don’t necessarily consist of parents and their own biological children. In 2018, around 42,237 children were adopted by married couples, and 15,704 children were adopted by single women.
