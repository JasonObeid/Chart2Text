Interestingly, since 2000, an exponential rise was seen in the number of Indian nationals traveling outside the country for leisure and other reasons. Travel bug and the economy Indian nationals are traveling more than ever before. However, far fewer Indians travel internationally compared to domestic travels. Since 2012, over one billion Indian nationals have traveled within the country. The various tax exemptions announced by the government in recent years was one of the reasons for an increase in disposable incomes among people. This seems to have been a welcome move, since a large section of the society in India travel on a need basis. The newly growing economy seems to have triggered an increase in travel and tourism expenditures especially by the middle and lower class of people who have built more capacity for savings. India’s busiest airport The aviation industry has also grown drastically over the last decade, with over 125 operational airports in the country as of today. The Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi was the busiest airport in terms of passenger traffic in 2019, while the United Arab Emirates was the leading destination for passengers traveling from India. The UAE was both, a leisure and business destination for many Indians.
