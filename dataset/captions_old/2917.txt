 Motorcycles were the most fatal transport mode in Great Britain. According to the latest available data, there were 83 recorded annual fatalities of motorcyclists for every billion passenger kilometer made between 2006 and 2015. This was significantly higher than pedestrian deaths, which at 26 per billion kilometers was the second most fatal mode of transport. By comparison, rail and air were the safest means of transport. Who are those seriously injured? In 2017, 5,941 motorcyclists were killed or seriously injured on British roads. This was the peak since the beginning of the reporting period in 2009. The vast majority of riders involved were male, at nearly 93 percent, while the age group most greatly affected were 20 to 24 year-olds. Annual road fatality numbers Despite a higher number of motorcycle deaths recorded per kilometers covered, due to the greater number of car users, the number of car occupants killed on British roads exceeded figures for motorcyclists. In 2017, 787 car occupants were fatally injured.
