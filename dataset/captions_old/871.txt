Comparatively, more and more people have been turning to flag football, where rather than tackling players to the ground (as done in tackle football) the defensive team must remove a flag from the player carrying the ball. In 2018, the number of participants in flag football was approximately 6.57 million, a number that has risen steadily over the past five years. Too old for outdoor activities?
