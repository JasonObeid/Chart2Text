 In 2017, exports of goods and services from the United States made up just over 12 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP). This is an increase from 9.23 percent of the GDP of the United States in 1990. Trade and foreign relations The United States’ GDP is the largest in the world, clocking in at around 18.57 trillion U.S. dollars in 2018. International trade is a huge boon to the U.S. economy, both financially and regarding foreign relations. Trade is a great door-opener for countries, as it shows that they are willing to work together, and as the most powerful economy in the world, the U.S. is an ideal trading partner. The benefits of free trade Free trade is especially beneficial for countries who work closely together, as it can help to grow their overall trade volume. The United States, for example, is part of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which is the largest free trade zone in the world. Since the implementation of NAFTA in 1994, Canada, Mexico, and the United States have all benefitted from the agreement through both job and GDP growth.
