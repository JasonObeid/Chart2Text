 Being one of the largest offshoring destinations for different IT companies across the world, the business process management market in India is of considerable importance. The information technology/business process management (IT-BPM) sector had contributed a share of around eight percent to the GDP of the country in 2017. BPM is more like a discipline than a process that incorporates methods to improve, analyze, automate and improve business processes. Domestic and international In the financial year 2018, the IT-BPM services sector had an export value of more than three times the export value of software products and engineering services. The sector has been generating big figures domestically as well. The direct employment generated from the IT-BPM industry in the country was more than three million in financial year 2016. What does the future hold? With a mixture of BPM and robotic process automation (RPA) in the picture, enhanced partnerships with the rapidly growing IT and BPM industry in India are quite likely to happen. The industry has been generating increased revenue over the years, and presumably with the fast-growing pace of the sector, the revenue generation will also be on the rise.
