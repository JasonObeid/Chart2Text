 Ford’s research and development expenditures came to about 7.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2019, putting an end to the gradual increase in R&D efforts of the past five years. The Michigan-based company appears to be adapting to altered fuel economy regulations and the declining demand for sedans and smaller cars in the United States by developing new designs and products. Focus of research and development activities In light of an increased concern from consumers and policymakers about the impact of fossil fuels on carbon dioxide emissions, Ford is working on a new fleet of electric vehicles with a goal of having sixteen plug-in electric vehicle models to market through 2022. Furthermore, the company's Lincoln brand has announced that it will partner up with unicorn Rivian to build electric vehicles. Another focus of Ford’s research and development department is artificial intelligence (AI). For example, Ford has invested more than one billion U.S. dollars in Argo AI, the most well-funded U.S.-based AI startup. Ford uses Argo AI technology in its vehicles; partially autonomous cars are expected to become a large market by 2025, valued at 36 billion U.S. dollars.
