 China was the top exporter of watches of any country worldwide, based on 2018 data. In 2018, China exported 656.3 million watches. Hong Kong was another leading exporter of watches in that year, at 204.7 million units. Leading Luxury Watches Rolex, the iconic Swiss watch brand, is the leading luxury watch brand in the world in terms of turnover. In 2017, the Rolex brand generated around four billion U.S. dollars in turnover. Swatch’s Omega brand came in second place, with around 2.33 billion U.S. dollars in turnover. Although Rolex seems to dominate the global luxury watch market, when comparing watch companies rather than brands, Swatch takes the lead with a 30 percent share of the market, while Rolex controls a 19.4 percent share. Cost of a Luxury Watch Luxury watches are known for being exorbitantly priced, functioning both as a status symbol as well as a fine timepiece. That being said, some luxury watch brands are more accessible than others. Tissot, produced by Swatch, has an average price of about 630 U.S. dollars, according to 2017 data. In that year, an average Patek Philippe watch sold for over 46 thousand U.S. dollars, making Patek Philippe the most expensive major luxury watch brand worldwide.
