The United Kingdom (UK) has one of the highest rates of asthma prevalence in Europe, with a reported 4.67 million individuals having the condition. Asthma is categorised as a chronic inflammatory disease which targets the air passages. The air tracts are thus narrowed, making it difficult for sufficient air to pass through. Asthma is known for causing symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath and coughing. The condition affects individuals differently with 49 percent of individuals in the United Kingdom reporting their asthma to be moderate, whereas 39 percent say their asthma is severe. Although there is no current cure for asthma, there are treatments available which help to control the symptoms.
