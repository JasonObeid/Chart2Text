U.S. motorcycle registrations by state In 2016, California reported the highest amount of registered private and commercial motorcycles in the country, followed by Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York (all of them with over 390,000 registrations that year). Not only is California the U.S. state with the highest number of motorcycles, but it is also the most populous state in the U.S. overall, representing close to 12 percent of the country’s total population. At the bottom of the ranking are Mississippi, Delaware and the District of Colombia with less than 29,000 registrations, as well as less populous states, including Wyoming, and Delaware. Despite the efforts made by each state to provide accurate vehicle (in this case, motorcycle) registration data, occurrences that would lead to a duplication –re-registration stands as one of the main reasons for this– of registrations are stated to be inevitable. The information is forwarded to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), who compiles it into an annual series of statistics relevant to the study of highway systems throughout the country.
