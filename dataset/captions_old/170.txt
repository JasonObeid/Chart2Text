 As one of the most popular sports leagues in the world, the NFL attracts huge television audiences and thousands of fans flocks to the stadiums every week to see their favorite teams in action. However, fans of the Los Angeles Chargers had to fork out a league-high average of almost 166 U.S. dollars to see their team play live at the Dignity Health Sports Park. In contrast, the Cleveland Browns charged a comparatively low 71.08 U.S. dollars for an average home game. Los Angeles Chargers The Los Angeles Chargers made the controversial decision to relocate to Los Angeles from San Diego in 2017. Although the team originally spent its first season in the NFL in 1960 in Los Angeles, it moved to San Diego just a year later and had been playing in the NFL there since 1970. The controversial 2017 switch can only have been compounded by the fact that an average home game ticket for the Chargers jumped from 84.55 U.S. dollars in 2016 to 165.77 U.S. dollars in 2019. LA’s new football home The change of city has, of course, meant a change in stadium and this has had an impact on the average attendance. While upward of 60,000 spectators regularly packed into the Chargers Park Stadium in San Diego, the Dignity Health Sports Park in California has a significantly lower capacity of around 30,000. As a result, average regular season home attendance for the Chargers has dipped significantly in the last two years. However, this is set to change in the near future as the Chargers are due to move to their new stadium, Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park, in 2020, a stadium that they will share with fellow Los Angeles-based franchise, the Los Angeles Rams. The Rams themselves only returned to Los Angeles in 2016 following a 22-year stay in St Louis. Their current home in Los Angeles is the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where an average of over 72,000 fans attended each Rams regular season home game in 2018. This marked a total of almost 580,000 fans making their way into the stadium across the entire regular season.
