 Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions in the United States have decreased significantly over the last decades. SO2 emissions have fallen to 2.82 million tons in 2017, in comparison to 31.22 million tons in 1970. This reduction in SO2 is largely due to the implementation of the Acid Rain Program under the Clean Air Act through a cap and trade program for fossil-fuel powered plants. What is sulfur dioxide and how does it impact health and the environment? SO2 is largely used as an indicator for gaseous sulfur oxides (SOx) as these gases are found in low concentrations in the atmosphere. SO2 is mostly emitted into the atmosphere through the burning of fossil fuels but can also be derived through some industrial processes like extracting metal from ore, operating vehicles and heavy equipment that burn high-sulfur content fuels, and through some natural sources like volcanoes. Exposure to SO2 can negatively impact the respiratory system in humans. High SO2 concentrations can also lead to the formation of other sulfur oxides which contribute to particulate matter pollution. Environmentally, SO2 can contribute to acid rain and can also damage the growth of plants.
