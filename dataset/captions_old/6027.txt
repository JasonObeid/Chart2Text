 Household waste volumes per person in England remained at a similar level between 2010 and 2017. Although there was an overall decrease during this period, the household volumes were still over 400 kilograms per person in 2017. The region which generated the largest volume of residual waste per household was the North East of England, where an average of 601 kilograms of waste was generated per person in 2017/2018. Recycling rates slowing down From 2000/2001 to 2011/2012, the recycling rates of household waste in England increased steadily from just 11.2 percent to 43 percent. However, since then there has been no noticeable increase in recycling rates. In fact, in 2015/2016, recycling rates dropped slightly to levels last seen in 2011/2012. In 2019, the UK Government set out plans to overhaul the waste system. One proposal to improve household recycling levels was to introduce more consistent sets of recyclable materials, such as separate food waste collection. Food waste Food waste is a growing concern worldwide, with an estimated 1.6 billion metric tons going to waste each year. This is approximately one third of the total food produced globally. In 2017, 75 kilograms of food per capita was wasted in the UK. In comparison, Italy, which has a similar population size to the UK generated 145 kilograms of food waste per capita.
