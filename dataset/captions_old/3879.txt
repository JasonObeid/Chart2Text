 The statistic shows the loan-to-deposit ratio in the global bank industry as of October 2011. If the granted loans amount to more than 100 percent in relation to customer deposits at the banks, the deposits are not sufficient for a refinancing of the loans. Thus, the banks depend on other means of refinancing. At the point these data were collected, the loan-deposit-ratio in China was at 60.6 percent.
