 As of 2020, there were 52 nuclear reactors under construction worldwide, with the majority being built in China. Comparatively, there were 186 nuclear reactors shut down permanently as of that year. The United States had permanently shut down 37 nuclear facilities as of February 2020. The construction and planning of a new nuclear power reactor is essential to the safety and operation of the facility. Methodical planning in plant design, materials, and labor ensures the success of the nuclear project. The time required for the construction of nuclear reactors can vary largely. Future of Nuclear Reactors The majority of planned new nuclear capacity is set in Asia. The increased capacity is also being created through upgrading already existing plants. Many existing atomic reactors are over 30 years old, which may exceed or is close to exceeding the designed lifetime of the reactors. It is also possible to replace major reactor components and some countries have also renewed licenses to extend the lifetime of plants. Many regions with existing nuclear power programs have further plans to build new reactors.
