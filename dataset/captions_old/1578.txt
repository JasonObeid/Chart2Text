 There are many women’s health products available in the U.S. The top women’s health product based on revenue in 2016 was Prolia, marketed by Amgen. Prolia generated 1.05 billion U.S. dollars in revenue in 2016. Prolia is used for the treatment of osteoporosis. Comparatively, the second highest revenue generating health product for women was Premarin which generated 956 million U.S. dollars. Women’s health concerns Women face specific health issues including certain cancers, diseases, mental health challenges and reproductive health issues. A recent survey indicated that the most pressing health issues among American women include mental health, cancer and heart health. The leading causes of death among women in the United States are similar to these concerns. Heart disease and cancer are the top killers, followed by stroke.Women’s preventative health measures Female health and family planning are hugely important for women’s health. About half of U.S. women had visited a gynecologist within the past year. Gynecologists are responsible for many aspects of female health including child birth, pap smears and breast exams. The percentage of U.S. women that had received a pap test has decreased in recent years. One female health product that is on the rise is contraceptive. The sales of over-the-counter contraceptive products for women has increased in recent years. Contraceptives have become much more affordable in the United States as there are no longer patents that prevent a combined use of estrogen and progesterone for oral contraception. Both of these hormones are easy to synthesize and manufacture.
