 The average price of gel fills in the United States increased moderately in the 2010’s, rising from 29.19 U.S. dollars in 2009 to 34.03 U.S. dollars in 2015. Gel fills A gel fill is a treatment for nails which already have a gel polish applied, and is designed to fill in the small gap that occurs between the cuticle and the base of the gel polish after several weeks of growth. Gel polishes can either be ‘soft’, where the treatment does not extend beyond the edge of the natural nail, or ‘hard’, where a harder form of gel can be used to create nail extensions. A full treatment including nail extensions is significantly more expensive than a soft gel polish. Gel versus acrylic The main alternative to gel-based nail treatments is acrylic treatments. Gel treatments are a relatively new invention compared to acrylic nail treatments, emerging in the 1980’s. Many people prefer gel nail treatments, claiming they have a more natural feeling while providing a longer-lasting, glossier finish with no chipping, peeling or cracking. However, gel nail are more complicated to apply than acrylic treatments, making acrylic fills and full sets cheaper than their gel alternatives. In addition, gels are more difficult to remove, meaning that removal often creates an additional cost – although it is possible to remove gel treatments at home.
