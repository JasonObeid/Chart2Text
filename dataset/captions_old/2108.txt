 General Motors incurred around 6.8 billion U.S. dollars in R&D costs in 2019. This figure puts the car manufacturer's R&D intensity at five percent. That said, the company declared interest to enter into cost sharing arrangements with third parties. In December 2019, General Motors and LG Chem partnered up to invest in a production facility for battery cells in Ohio.
