 In the United Kingdom, retail sales tend to peak during the last month of the year, holiday shopping being the likeliest culprit. In December 2018, the sales value of retailing in the UK amounted to 51 billion British pounds, the highest in the last three-year period. 2018 was also the year in which UK retailing, including automotive fuel, delivered its shiniest results. In that year, an additional 18 billion British pounds were spent in the retail industry compared to 2017. Retail turnover on the climb Running parallel to this, the turnover of retail trade in the UK made significant strides. Over the past 10 years, UK retail businesses consistently generated improved turnover figures, with 2017 marking a big boost on the previous year.

While online marketplaces are becoming regular staples of everyday life, high street retailers too are setting up online businesses to support their store sales. In the UK, the share of online sales in all retailing increased to its highest level as of January 2019. A regular force on the scene for some years already, online is now driving growth in the UK retail sector.
