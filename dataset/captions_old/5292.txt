 In the three months leading up to November 5, 2017, the grocery market in Great Britain grew by 3.8 percent compared to the same period a year earlier. Compared to the growth during the last three years this constitutes a sizeable increase. The entire grocery market amounted to 185.2 billion British pounds in 2017. Compared to the prior year it had increased by over five and a half billion pounds. Market shares of grocery stores As of May 2019, the four most important players on the grocery market were Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda, and Morrisons. While Morrisons share of the market was just over ten percent, both Asda as well as Sainsbury’s were able to claim around fifteen percent. The market leader Tesco had a share of over a quarter of the market, despite the companies’ market share falling since 2015. The next big company, Aldi was still over two percent away from overtaking Morrisons. Sales channels The most relevant grocery sales channels measured by generated monetary value are supermarkets and convenience stores. Hypermarkets and discounters, smaller channels in comparison, still surpass online sales. However, the number of people who tried ordering groceries online had almost reached thirty percent in 2016. It is very likely that the online channel will grow in relevance.
