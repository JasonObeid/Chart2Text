 The gross domestic product (GDP) of Bangladesh grew to 288 billion U.S. dollars in 2018. This is an increase of about 80 billion U.S. dollars since 2014, and this growth is projected to continue at least until 2024. Contributing factors Bangladesh is largely an export economy with a consistently negative trade balance. Much of its exports are manufactured goods, most notably garments. These goods are labor-intensive, and Bangladesh’s low wages make the country an attractive target for foreign direct investment. What does this mean for the Bangladeshi people? Bangladesh has a large population, roughly twice that of Germany. As such, GDP per capita is still low compared to global averages. However, a rapid increase in GDP per capita usually indicates a higher level of development, driving increases in many aspects of the people’s lives. For example, a more developed health care system leads to a considerably lower infant mortality rate. In a wider sense, this means lifting millions of people out of poverty.
