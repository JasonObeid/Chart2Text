Trade in Turkey Turkey is a growing market and recognized as one of the world’s newest industrialized countries. Partially due Turkey’s fast growing economy, the country was able to save up and maintain a relatively large currency reserve. Currency reserves are most important in dire financial situations. Turkey is also a member of the G-20 major economies and the EU Customs Union, an organization made up of EU countries as well as neighboring countries that essentially allow no customs to be levied on goods being traded within the borders of these countries. As a result, a large percentage of goods imported and exported were going to and coming from countries within the custom borders.

Primary imports into Turkey consist of machinery, chemicals, semi-finished goods, fuels and transport equipment.
