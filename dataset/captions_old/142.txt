 The Soccer Power Index ranks domestic soccer teams in the world based on goals scored, adjusted goals, shot-based expected goals and non-shot expected goals. These criteria produce offensive and defensive ratings for each team which are then converted to an overall score on the Soccer Power Index. According to the index, Manchester City is currently the best club team worldwide, with a Soccer Power Index score of 94.9. The rise of Manchester City In the 2018/19 season, Manchester City claimed the domestic treble in England, having won the Premier League title as well as both cups. Their 6-0 thrashing of Watford in the final of the FA Cup marked their sixth success in the tournament. However, they have some way to go to catch up with their city rivals, Manchester United, who have 12 FA Cup victories to their name. Since being taken over by the Abu Dhabi United Group in August 2008, Manchester City’s rise has been astronomical. Following a huge cash injection, the club was able to attract big names and titles soon followed. The club’s brand value also increased almost tenfold between 2011 and 2018. European giants The most prestigious European tournament is undoubtedly the Champions League, in which the top teams from the domestic leagues battle it out in group stages, followed by a knockout stage until there is only one team left. Real Madrid have dominated the competition in recent times and took home the trophy four out of five times between 2013 and 2018. They currently sit top of the pile of all-time Champions League winners, with 13 titles to their name.
