 What is the price of a house in Belgium? In 2018, a house in Belgium would cost approximately 251,584 euros. This is an increase of roughly 4.7 percent compared to the previous year and an increase of approximately 11 percent compared to 2014. Note, however, that there are large price differences between the three Belgian regions. A house in the Brussels Capital-Region (the city of Brussels along and its surrounding villages) costed around 453,000 euros in 2018. Dutch-speaking Flanders and French-speaking Wallonia reached average prices of 277,000 euros and 189,000 euros respectively. Of the Belgian provinces, houses in Hainaut were the cheapest. The ranking shown here only includes what in Flemish Dutch is referred to as “woonhuizen” and as “maisons” in French and therefore does not include apartments. How much is an apartment in Belgium? In 2018, an apartment in Belgium would cost approximately 220,000 euros. Apartment prices increased by 1.8 percent compared to 2017, which is lower than the house prices (4.7 percent). The source mentions that Flanders and the Brussels Capital-Region are the main drivers behind this, as apartment prices increased by 1.6 percent and 2.4 percent respectively. Wallonia remained stable at +0.5 percent. Is residential property in Belgium expensive when compared to the rest of Europe? The house price index (HPI) of Belgium did not increase as fast as that of other European countries in 2018. Residential property in Belgium (which includes both newly constructed as well as existing property) increased by 2.6 percent between the third quarter of 2017 and the third quarter of 2018, whereas prices in Slovenia and the Netherlands increased by more than ten percent. When the HPI is corrected for inflation, however, numbers show that only Swedish and Luxembourgish housing was more expensive than those in Belgium.
