 By a margin of nearly two thousand cars, Toyota proved itself as the leading brand of sold passenger cars in Finland in the year 2018. The Japanese car manufacturer managed to grab a sale of roughly 15 thousand passenger cars, whereas the runner-up car brand Volkswagen sold a little over 13 thousand units. Volkswagen leading the sales of used cars While Toyota remains as the leader for newly registered cars, the brand was not as successful regarding the sales of used cars in 2018, as customers preferred both Volkswagen and Volvo over the Japanese company. This could be also seen in the most sold used car models, where Toyota only managed to reach 9th spot with its Toyota Avensis model. In this category, Volkswagen Golf led the sales with over 21 thousand used cars, compared to nearly 17 thousand sales of Škoda Octavia.
