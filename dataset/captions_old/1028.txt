 In 2018, there were roughly 3.3 million German households with a household net income of under 900 euros per month. In total, there were approximately 40.4 million private households in Germany that year. Disposable net income Based on most recent figures, the largest number of households had a monthly net income of 3,200 to 4,500 euros. While at first glance this amount may seem substantial, based on general German standards of living, it’s worth noting that flexibility and expenditure depends on the number of people living in a household, or rather the number of earners in relation to that number. In the case of employed population members, what remains as disposable net income is influenced by various regular payments made by households after the already taxed salary arrives. These payments include, but are not limited to, rent, different types of insurance, repaying loans, fees for internet and mobile phone services. Food and housing When looking at private household spending in Germany, consistent patterns emerge. Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuel made up the largest share, followed by food, beverages and tobacco. Spending for the latter has only been going up in recent years.
