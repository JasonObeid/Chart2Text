 There were 77,647 branches of FDIC-insured commercial banks in the United States in 2018. After a period of growth from 2000 to 2008, this number has been slowly diminishing in the past few years. In 2018, Wells Fargo led the ranking of banks with the highest number of branches. What does the FDIC do? The FDIC (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation) is an agency created by the United States Congress that guarantees the deposits in commercial banks up to 250,000 U.S. dollars. This protects depositors in the event that the bank becomes insolvent. It also enables banks to issue more loans, since depositors may prefer banks that are insured by the FDIC. Trends in the banking industry While the number of branches has stayed relatively stable, the number of FDIC-insured commercial banks has declined in recent years. As younger generations become more accustomed to online and digital banking, the need for bank branches may also wane.
