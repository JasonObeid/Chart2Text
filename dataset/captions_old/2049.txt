 Approximately 37.9 million tourist visits were made to the UK from overseas in 2018, reflecting a decline for the first time this decade. Tourist numbers had been following an increasing trend, with over 39 million arrivals in 2017. However a hope of hitting the 40 million mark was missed as tourism began to slowdown. The number of overnight stays by visitors to the UK reflected a similar trend, with figures dropping in 2018. The data is based on interviews with passengers arriving and departing from the country and includes visits for all purposes, including for vacation, business, study, visiting friends and family and other leisure purposes.
