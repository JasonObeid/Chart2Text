 In 2017, there were 106 recorded traffic fatalities in Norway. The Scandinavian country had seen the number of road deaths drop significantly in the last ten years and by 2017 reported 20 incidents per one million inhabitants. This was the lowest road fatality prevalence in Europe. The Norwegian Government follows the multi-national road safety plan “Vision Zero”, which seeks to see the number of fatalities and serious injuries reduced to zero. In its “National Plan of Action for Road Safety” the Government elaborated on its short-term goals of having a maximum of 350 such incidents by 2030. Non-fatal accidents In order to reach said goals, the country still has some way to go. Despite more than halving the number of road accidents, by 2017 there were still 5,262 people, who had been non-fatally injured on Norwegian roads. Vehicle stock As of 2018, there were a total of 5.52 million vehicles registered in the country. Passenger cars accounted for the lion’s share of these at 2.75 million and were followed by trailers.
