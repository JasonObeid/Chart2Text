 In 2019, Disney's releases accounted for 33.1 percent of all earnings at the box office in North America, up from 26 percent in the previous year. Disney has almost doubled its market share since 2014, and boasts a wealth of content from other studios thanks to multiple major acquisitions, including 21st Century Fox, which Disney acquired in early 2019. When taking Fox's market share into account and combining this figure with Disney's, the latter's market share actually amounted to 38 percent in 2019.
