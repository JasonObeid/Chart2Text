 The statistic depicts the brand value of the most valuable football teams in Major League Soccer in 2012. The Seattle Sounders FC had a brand value of 58 million U.S. dollars in 2012. A brand is defined here as the trademark and associated intellectual property. Football clubs are made up of a mixture of fixed tangible assets (stadium, training ground) and disclosed intangible assets (purchased players) with brand value. To calculate brand values the Royalty Relief method was used. This approach assumes the company doesn't own their brand and must license it from a theoretical third party. The method determines how much it would cost to do this.
