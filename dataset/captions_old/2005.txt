 The city of Miami has hosted the most Super Bowls in the history of the NFL. The Florida city has hosted the showpiece event on eleven occasions, most recently when it welcomed fans from around the world at the Super Bowl in 2020. The history of the Super Bowl The first four editions of the Super Bowl, contested from 1967 to 1970, were played between the champions of the American Football League (AFL) and the National Football League (NFL). The rival leagues merged ahead of the 1970 season, making Super Bowl V in 1971 the first championship game in the modern era of the NFL – Super Bowl LIV in 2020 will be the 50th as a united league. The Super Bowl trophy was renamed the Vince Lombardi Trophy ahead of Super Bowl V in honor of the former Green Bay Packers coach who passed away at the start of that season – Lombardi led the Packers to two of their four Super Bowl wins. A century of NFL football The NFL celebrated a landmark occasion during the 2019 season: it is the 100th season of the league. The inaugural season of the American Professional Football Association – later renamed the NFL – took place in 1920, and two of the founding teams remain to this day: the Chicago Cardinals (now known as the Arizona Cardinals) and the Decatur Staleys (now Chicago Bears). It would be fitting if the oldest rivalry in the NFL contested the Super Bowl in 2020, adding to their combined three Super Bowl appearances.
