 This statistic displays the office vacancy rate in London (UK) from 2006 to 2013 and a forecast thereof until 2019. Office vacancy rates are numerical calculations of all office space that is available to rent in any given market. The calculation is presented as percentage and it is the opposite to office occupancy rates. The office vacancy rate in London amounted to seven percent in 2013 (decrease from 10.2 percent in 2010) and it was projected to decrease further to 4.4 percent by 2019. Office vacancy rates are understood as one of the indicators, foretelling the future good or poor economic performance of the commercial sector in London. The lower the office vacancy rate, the better conditions for business, as companies have confidence in expanding and upgrading, and the market witnesses numerous new entries into the business. It is also interesting to juxtapose the projections for the leading European cities, such as for example the vacant office space in Frankfurt or office vacancies on the market in Paris, in view of the theory of global centers of business being interconnected and more similar to one another, than to the region they are located in.
