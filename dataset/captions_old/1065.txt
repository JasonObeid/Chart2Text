 Between 2010 and the first half of 2018, the overall household price for electricity in Denmark increased by approximately 4.53 euro cents per kilowatt-hour to 31.23 euro cents. This was the highest price during this period. Electricity prices per kilowatt-hour were at their lowest in the first half of 2010 at 26.7 euro cents. Danish households spent the most per kilowatt-hour of electricity throughout Europe in 2018, with prices slightly more expensive than in Germany. Energy taxes highest in Copenhagen One of the reasons for the high price of electricity in Denmark is that taxes account for a large proportion of the overall price. As of January 2019, energy taxes made up a share of approximately 16 percent of the average EU residential end-user electricity price structure. In the Danish capital Copenhagen, however, energy taxes amounted to 41 percent. This was by far the highest energy taxation in major European cities. High quality electricity supply Whilst households in Denmark pay some of the highest electricity prices around, the electricity supply is ranked as one of the best in the world with an index score of 6.8 out of a possible 7. Only Scandinavian neighbor Norway, Singapore and Switzerland had a higher ranking than Denmark in 2018.
