 More than half of the world’s population identify as feminists - in India alone, over 80 percent of respondents very much or somewhat agreed that they defined themselves as feminists. Surprisingly, this number is much lower in developed countries like the United States or Germany (with not even 40 percent of respondents agreeing), which might be due to the bad reputation feminism - wrongfully – has. But are some really more equal than others? Despite its deceptive title, feminism is not about establishing superiority of women – its core concept is equality for all, no matter their sex, gender, or orientation. Achieving this equality means championing women with more force and verve than has been done before, since today’s societies are deeply patriarchal – i.e. they favor men over women. Critics often misinterpret this support of women as an attempt to suppress and attack men – when in fact, feminism and equality for all benefits them as well. The country of the poets and thinkers seems stuck In Germany, feminism is on the rise, but traditional gender roles and insufficient information still hinder progress. Only a third of German women, and even fewer German men, define themselves as feminist, while at the same time, over 70 percent of women and almost 60 percent of men would agree that gender equality is important to them. Still, they are not convinced that discrimination against women is ending anytime soon. Most of all, they say, reallocating responsibility and adjusting payrolls would help to achieve a feminist society.
