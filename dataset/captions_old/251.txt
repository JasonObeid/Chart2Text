The number of primary care doctors is only slightly higher than those of non-primary care.

Around half of U.S. citizens that visit a physician, go to a primary care physician. However, family practice, pediatrics, and internal medicine are among the lowest paid salaries for physicians. Specialties such as orthopedic surgeons, urology, and invasive cardiology earn some of the highest wages in the country.
