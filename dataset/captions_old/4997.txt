 According to recent data, the rate of reported cases of chancroids in the U.S. has dropped to very few cases in recent years. There has been a significant decline in recent history with a high rate occurring of almost 3.3 cases per 100,000 people in 1950. Chancroids are a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by a bacterium and classified by genital ulcers. Sexually Transmitted Infections in the U.S. Recent data suggests that there are as few as 3 cases of chancroids in the U.S. annually. The number of chancroid cases has also been declining globally. Other STIs, such as syphilis have similarly been decreasing in the U.S. in modern history. However there are other STIs that are more common in the U.S. For example, the rate of chlamydia cases has increased dramatically in recent years.STI Prevention Some STIs are preventable through vaccination and condoms. A survey from 2018 indicated that just over half of U.S. female teenagers were up to date on their human papillomavirus vaccinations. Condoms, while known for their effectiveness in preventing sexually transmitted infections, are not used as frequently as public health officials would like. When U.S. male adults were asked about their usage of condoms in their last sexual encounter, less than half indicated that they had used a male condom.
