However, with a change in government policy in the 1990s that made way for globalization and increasing foreign investment, the private sector was split by regulators into old and new banks. The very first bank in this sector, founded in 1899, was Nendungadi Bank in Calicut or Kozhikode, Kerala. Since 2014, as part of the central government’s inclusion program for affordable access and expansion to financial services, private sector banks have accepted over one million recipients as of February 2019, the largest being ICICI Bank with over 436 thousand.
