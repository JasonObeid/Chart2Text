 The Indian sports industry has grown dramatically over the last few years. The industry became one of the fastest growing with a margin of around ten percent over the global average. The total revenue of the industry was projected to be around 1.9 million U.S. dollars in 2015. The Indian Premier League, Hockey India League, Indian Badminton League, Pro Kabbadi and the Indian Sports League are some of the initiatives giving a major boost to the industry and also encouraging the younger generations to take up other sports in a country where cricket has dominated the sports culture since the British rule. Media is popularity Media investments continue to be an essential part of the industry via broadcast and advertising to reach TV households. Hindi seemed to be the preferred choice when it comes to watching sports. Cricket dominated the on-ground sponsorship among sports, but the nation has re-discovered its love for kabaddi, a game originating within the country, which has already overtaken football in terms of popularity and sponsorship. Cricketers, however, are still the best-paid sportspeople. The bigger picture 2019 was a successful year for Indian sports not just limited to the mainstream. Ace badminton player PV Sindhu won the gold at the World Championship. The shooting team finished with five gold medals in Rio, and the country lead the ISSF Senior World Cup events with 16 gold medals. The general audience in India, had seemed to make the shift from just daily soaps as a source of entertainment to the domestic sports industry, giving a much-needed boost to the latter in the global market.
