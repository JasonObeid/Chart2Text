 This statistic shows the monthly amount of cars sold by MINI in the United Kingdom (UK) between July 2016 and December 2019. Peaks in registration numbers were recorded in March and September of each year, which was due to the issuing of license plates by the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in those months. In September 2019, around 12,700 new MINI cars had been sold.
