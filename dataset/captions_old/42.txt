 In 2018 Germany's share of total contributions to the budget of the European Union was 20.78 percent, the highest of any EU member state. Only three other member states contributed more than ten percent to the EU budget, France (15.58 percent) the United Kingdom (11.88 percent) and Italy (11.74 percent). The small island-nation of Malta contributed the least to the EU budget, at 0.08 percent. Largest economies in Europe The amount which EU member states contribute to the EU budget is heavily linked to the size of its economy. Germany, for example, has the largest economy in the whole of Europe, with Gross domestic product reaching almost 3.4 trillion Euros in 2018. Britain and France have the second and third largest economies in Europe with GDPs of 2.39 and 2.35 trillion euros respectively. UK Rebate The amount which the United Kingdom contributes to the European Union budget was a key issue during the Brexit referendum of 2016. Prior to the referendum, the “Leave” campaign famously claimed that the UK sends the EU 350 million British pounds a week, a figure which omitted the rebate which the UK receives from the EU as well as public sector receipts. As of 2018, the UK contributed approximately 8.93 billion to the EU budget and received 8.52 billion back.
