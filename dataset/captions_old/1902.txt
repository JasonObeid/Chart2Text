 Johnson & Johnson’s share of the baby care market worldwide is expected to gradually decline in the coming years to hit a low of 17.9 percent in 2021, a decrease of almost eight percent since 2013. Despite such forecast downturns within their baby care segment, Johnson & Johnson’s total revenue has continued to increase in recent years. Johnson & Johnson origins Johnson & Johnson, headquartered in New Jersey, operates over 200 subsidiary companies in 60 countries within the pharmaceutical, medical devices and consumer healthcare segments. The company originated in 1885 with the creation of ready-to-use surgical dressings. Their first products were produced in 1886 with a logo bearing great resemblance to their logo of today. This makes it one of the longest-used business logos to date. Competition for market share Kimberly-Clark and Procter & Gamble (P&G) are two of Johnson and Johnson’s fiercest competitors within this market. Kimberly-Clark’s share of the total baby care market is expected to remain relatively unchanged, staying at around 8 percent into 2024. Procter & Gamble's market share of disposable baby diapers, baby wipes and training pants worldwide is also expected to remain constant over the coming years at around 18 percent.
