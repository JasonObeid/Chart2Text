 Uber Technologies went public on May 9, 2019. This was the largest initial public offering (IPO) in the United States in 2019, raising 8.1 billion U.S. dollars. As shown in this statistic, the ten largest IPOs that year each raised over a billion dollars in capital. Why do companies go public? Private companies have limited access to capital and mainly use traditional sources to finance their expenditures. While such firms have more freedom to operate without reporting to investors, this also blocks the companies from raising access directly from the public. The value raised by IPOs can be significant. In hopes of gaining access to this capital, the number of IPOs in the United States generally exceeds 100 firms each year. Risks of an IPO IPO is a long and costly process. It necessitates cooperation with investment advisory firms to ensure that all requirements are met and that the process is optimally planned. A public company is subject to governmental and public scrutiny – any negative information, such as rumors about insider trading, can result in falling stock prices. Also, the time when going public is crucial. Even a prospering company can have a very low return in times of recession.
