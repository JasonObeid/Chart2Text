 Just five percent of houses in the United Kingdom (UK) were not heated using a central heating system, as of 2018. The share of houses using a central heating system climbed steadily until 2005, rising from 90 percent in the year 2000. 86 percent of properties use gas as the fuel for their central heating system. Energy used by heating Heating is a major energy user in the United Kingdom (UK). In 2017, the UK used an amount of energy equivalent to approximately 55 million metric tons of oil for heating and cooling. Solar energy used for electricity and heat generation in 2017 amounted to just over one million metric tons of oil equivalent. Heating oil price variations across Europe Despite the prominence of gas-fired central heating systems, Great Britain enjoys access to some of the cheapest average prices for heating oil in Europe, at 638.1 euros per 1,000 liters. This is slightly cheaper than the Republic of Ireland and Germany, and significantly cheaper than the 1,158 euros per thousand liters seen in Sweden or the 1,290 euros per thousand liters that Danish customers pay.
