 It is expected that by 2023, around 62.5 million Filipinos will become users of a social network. Considering the forecasted population of around 118 million, it reflects the high popularity of social media in the Philippines. Current state of social media in the Philippines The Philippines have been called the social media capital of the world, because most of the social media users have an extraordinarily high usage time of about four hours per day. Additionally, they are known as early technology adopters, as well as being highly internet-savvy. Yet the infrastructure cannot keep up with the population’s needs. The archipelago consists of around seven thousand islands, making it difficult for the government to provide basic connectivity. As of 2017, around 64 million out of 105 million inhabitants had internet access. While 81 percent of the 18- to 24-year-olds were already online, only twelve percent of those aged 55 years and older were able to access the internet . How are the Philippines able to improve their accessibility? Since it is widely recognized that internet access has an impact on economic growth, local authorities must focus on further expanding the network. There are few promising technologies to do so: fiber cables could be installed and even reduce the cost of telecommunication companies in the end. The upcoming 5G network could help connect remote areas with a trustworthy connection, and if that is too far into the future, satellites could be a viable choice for now; they are able to reach every point on the earth, making them key for achieving nationwide connectivity.
