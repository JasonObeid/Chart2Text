 This statistic presents the share of consumers who bought products on impulse when shopping online and in-store in the United Kingdom, as of a survey conducted between November 2015 and January 2016. The survey showed that shoppers were more likely to buy on impulse or recommendation when shopping in-store than online, with 35 percent of consumers doing so during the survey period. Females are more likely to make impulse purchases on the internet, with 21.7 percent saying they come way with items they had not planned on buying. This figure is much smaller for men, who only impulse buy 13.4 percent of the time. Special times of the year such as Valentine's Day can be key times for impulse purchases. Nearly one quarter of people who buy Valentine's Day gifts say that they bought the products for their partner on impulse. One industry that thrives well from impulse purchases is the music industry, where in 2015, 40.7 percent of people bought an album without planning on doing so.
