 As of 2016, the projected number of people that would become uninsured would increase dramatically if President Trump were to recall or replace the Affordable Care Act (also called Obamacare). Should President Trump repeal the Affordable Care Act without a replacement, it is estimated that the number of U.S. residents that would become uninsured would increase from 27 million to 49 million. U.S. health insurance The U.S. health insurance system is considered a hybrid system of private funding, private business funding and some government funding for individual health coverage. There is currently no universal health insurance system for U.S. residents. The leading health insurance company in the U.S. as of 2017, by direct premiums written was UnitedHealth Group Inc., followed by Anthem Inc. Revenues generated by life and health insurance companies have more or less stagnated in recent history. The Affordable Care Act The Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010 with the goals of making affordable health insurance available to more people and to expand Medicaid coverage in the U.S. Since 2010 the number of U.S. residents under the age of 65 without health insurance has dropped dramatically. Recent data also indicates that Medicaid enrollment has increased in recent years. It is estimated that repealing the Affordable Care Act in the United States could result in the approximately 26.5 thousand excess deaths per year.
