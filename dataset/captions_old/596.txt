 As of January 2020, Ryan from Ryan's World (formerly known as Ryan ToysReview) had reached almost 35.2 billion lifetime video views, making the elementary schooler the most viewed YouTube channel owner of all time. This achievement unseated former first-ranked video game commentator Felix Kjellberg, who produces videos under the name PewDiePie. Ryan has been uploading YouTube videos since March 2015, and mainly features in videos where he is playing with and reviews toys “for kids, by a kid”. Ryan ToysReview Among Ryan’s most popular content are his unboxing videos, where he films himself opening packages of newly purchased items. Unboxing videos are nothing new, and during a November 2018 survey of U.S. vlog viewers, 27 percent of respondents stated that they watched product reviews and unboxings at least once a week. Ryan’s content is described as “every small kid’s dream job”; opening toys and playing with them every day. His cheerful manner coupled with his innocent, easy to watch content make him popular among parents watching such videos with their kids. In the year ending June 2019, Ryan led the ranking of the highest-paid YouTube stars with approximately 26 million U.S. dollars in annual earnings. Most of Ryans’s earnings are from pre-roll ads on his videos and, to a lesser extent, a recently released line of collectible toys.
