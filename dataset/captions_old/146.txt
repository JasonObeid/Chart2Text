 During the 2019/2020 football season, Manchester City paid the highest average annual player salary out of all teams in the English Premier League (EPL), with an average of roughly 8.73 million U.S. dollars. Manchester United was the highest paying club in the EPL for the previous two seasons, while Sheffield United, which moved up into the EPL from the Football League Championship this season, paid the lowest annual average of approximately 910 thousand U.S. dollars per player in 2019/20. Payments in similar European leagues Manchester City may be the most generous employer in the EPL at this point but they don’t hold this title at the European level. Juventus, in Italy’s Serie-A for example, pay their players an average of 10.1 million U.S. dollars. This slightly higher amount comes in spite of the facts that the EPL generates revenue of more than twice as much as the Serie A overall. Money reflects fandom Manchester United holds the record for most EPL championships won and with such success comes a large fanbase. When asked ”Which club is your favourite Premier League club?”, 22.6 percent of English stated Manchester United, followed by 16.4 percent naming Liverpool Football Club.
