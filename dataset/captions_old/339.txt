 As of January 2020, the ranking of most popular YouTube channels based on monthly views is dominated by music and children’s content. Cocomelon - Nursery Rhymes was ranked second with 2.36 billion channel views in the preceding 30 days. Indian entertainment channel T-Series was ranked first with over 3.23 billion views. Top YouTube channels When looking at the most-subscribed YouTube channels, a similar picture emerges: Indian music label T-Series was ranked first with over 123 million channel subscribers, followed by video game commentator Felix Kjellberg, aka PewDiePie, with 102 million subscribers. The top spot for the most subscribed YouTube channel was subject of a heated contest, “PewDiePie vs. T-Series”, which drew much attention online. The rivalry between the multi-channel network T-Series and independent, standalone channel PewDiePie represents the growing divide of subcultures on YouTube, as well as a shift towards the ever-increasing commercialization of the platform. YouTube Creator earnings Despite the ongoing battle for the top spot and controversies regarding the content of his videos, Kjellberg is still ranked among the highest-earning YouTube channel creators in 2019 with annual channel earnings of 13 million U.S. dollars. Ranked first was Ryan from Ryan's World with 26 million U.S. dollars. Ryan’s channel was set up by his parents in March 2015, as his young age means he is unable to set up a YouTube channel by himself.
