How many households are in the U.S.? In 2019, there were 128.58 million households in the United States. This is a significant increase from 1960, when there were 52.8 million households in the U.S. What counts as a household? According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a household is considered to be all persons living within one housing unit. This includes apartments, houses, or single rooms, and consists of both related and unrelated people living together. For example, two roommates who share a living space but are not related would be considered a household in the eyes of the Census. It should be noted that group living quarters, such as college dorms, are not counted as households in the Census. Household changes While the population of the United States has been increasing, the average size of households in the U.S. has decreased since 1960. In 1960, there was an average of 3.33 people per household, but in 2018, this figure had decreased to 2.53 people per household. Additionally, two person households make up the majority of American households, followed closely by single-person households.
