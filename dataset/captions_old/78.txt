 Manitoba, one of the three prairie provinces in Canada, was home to the highest cigarette prices in March 2018. Consumers were paying 139.83 Canadian dollars for 200 cigarettes, almost 30 dollars more than the national average retail price of 112.06 dollars for 200 cigarettes in the same month. Consumers could purchase 200 cigarettes for just 96.36 Canadian dollars in Canada’s largest province of Quebec. Why do prices vary regionally? Smoking products are tightly regulated across Canada, with regulations and legal smoking ages varying between provinces. Tobacco taxes can be used to dissuade consumers from purchasing cigarettes, in order to reduce rates of smoking and related diseases. Canadian provinces have their own governmental budgets and, therefore, the power to implement their own tobacco taxes. This creates differences in prices across the country. Future growth in the Canadian tobacco marketRetail sales of tobacco products and supplies have steadily increased year on year, reaching an all-time high of 10.93 billion Canadian dollars in 2017. May 2018 was a milestone month for the industry, with regulatory framework being passed to legalize the manufacturing and sale of vaping products in Canada. Similarly to cigarette retailing, tight regulations will apply to the sale of vaping products and will vary province to province. Almost a third of Canadian consumers were quite familiar with vaping in 2018; this figure, along with retail sales of tobacco products and supplies, is only set to increase.
