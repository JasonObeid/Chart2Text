 As of 2018, 54 percent of U.S.-based respondents stated that their favorite moving watching location was at home. Only around 13 percent of respondents stated that they preferred to watch movies in a theatre, while 22 percent stated that they like the theatre and home options equally. Movie viewership Movies have long been a staple of the entertainment industry in both the United States and across the globe. Around 19 percent of U.S. adults claim to watch or stream movies every day, while an additional 26 percent state that they watch movies several times per week. Streaming services like Netflix and Hulu have provided consumers with a way to watch films on the go, while theatres continue to provide people with an entire movie-going experience. Despite this added competition from streaming services, annual ticket sales have remained relatively stable for the past 10 years. The 2019 film ‘Avengers: Endgame’ grossed nearly 2.8 billion dollars worldwide, making it the most successful film of all time in terms of global box office revenue. With more ways to watch, consumers from all around the world are showing more interested in movies that ever before.
