Additional information on terrorism in Iraq For nearly two decades Iraq has been one of the foremost battlegrounds in the so-called War on Terror. The number of deaths in Iraq due to terrorism between 2006 and 2018 shows a decline in the number of deaths following 2007 and a subsequent rise in 2013, followed by a decline again from 2017. Unfortunately for Iraq citizens this reflects the weakening of Al Qaeda being followed by a destructive rise then fall of Islamic State. Islamic State, who operates in other countries including Iraq’s neighbor Syria, were responsible for the two worst terrorist attacks in 2015 by number of fatalities. The attacks in QAIM and Bani Saad further increased the high frequency of Iraqi fatalities resulting from terrorism. The devastating effect groups such as Islamic State have had on the people in Iraq goes beyond the tragic loss of friends and loved ones. In 2015, Iraq suffered the second-largest amount of property losses of any country impacted by terrorism. This cost totaled 519 million US dollars. The preferences of terrorist groups in Iraq appear to be geared armed conflicts and bombings. In 2011, the number of kidnappings in Iraq was far fewer than in Somalia or Afghanistan where kidnappings are regularly committed for the purpose of extortion for political and economic gains.
