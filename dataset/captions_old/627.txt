 South Korea and China had the highest landed price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the world at 4.43 U.S. dollars per million Btu, compared with the United States (Lake Charles) at 2.15 U.S. dollars per million Btu. LNG landed prices refers to the price that is received at the regasification terminal. These prices are determined by a netback price which is based on the effective price for a seller or producer at a defined location. The global trade volume of LNG has steadily increased over the last few decades. LNG demand growth Increased gas demand and improved liquefaction technology has prompted growth in the gas market and the entry of new players. Traditionally, LNG prices were strongly influenced by crude oil, however, as the market grows, the LNG market has begun to develop independent benchmarks. Japan, China, and South Korea are currently leading in LNG imports, with almost half of the growth from China alone. However, this growth is expected to soften as pipelines from Russia begin to supply China with LNG in the coming years.
