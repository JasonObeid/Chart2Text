 Global installed electricity capacity for fossil fuels was about 4.15 terawatts in 2017, compared to 1.01 terawatts of installed renewable capacity. Electricity generation from fossil fuels has consistently decreased over the last few years, whereas renewable electricity generation has, in turn, increased to meet demand. Renewable sources now account for almost 27 percent of global electricity generation. The cost of renewable sources has decreased over time, making them increasingly more cost effective and more common around the world. As renewable technologies become more feasible in electricity generation, these sources gradually replace conventional fossil fuel sources. Electricity capacity explained Generation capacity is a measure of the maximum power output, the amount of electricity a generator can produce at full power. There are three main types of capacity. Nameplate generating capacity is determined by the generator manufacturer. Net summer generation capacity is determined through performance tests during the peak demand in the summer months and in contrast, net winter capacity is determined during peak demand in the winter.
