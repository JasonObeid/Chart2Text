 This statistic displays the annual exchange rate (average or standardized measure) of the euro to the Japanese yen (EUR JPY), according to data from the European Central Bank, from the introduction of the euro in 1999 up until 2019. The average, or standardized, measure shows the calculation based on many observations throughout the period in question, which is different than an annual measure at point in time: this denotes concrete values as of the end of the year. Between the years of 2000 and 2007, the average annual exchange rate of the euro to the Japanese yen noted an overall increase. In 2007, the euro to Japanese yen annual average exchange rate was equal to 161.25, which meant that one euro could buy 161.25 Japanese yen. By 2019 this value had decreased overall, to a value of 122.01, which meant that one euro could buy 122.01 Japanese yen.
