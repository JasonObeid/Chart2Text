After several years of fluctuation, Poland’s GDP recently reached an all-time high of around 586 billion U.S. dollars in 2018. Major changes in the nineties Poland suffered an economic crisis during the late 1980s, with shortages of goods and a debt crisis among the reasons for a rising inflation rate.

Poland’s GDP per capita reflects this change, rising from around 1,600 U.S. dollars in 1990 to more than 4,300 U.S. dollars in 1999.
