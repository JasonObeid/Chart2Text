 This statistic shows the countries considered to be the most trustworthy worldwide in 2014, based on a survey conducted in six countries. Of respondents, 42 percent viewed Canada as a country with trustworthy people, with the United Kingdom (UK) following at 39 percent. In 2016 a similar report on most reputable countries also found Canada to have one of the best reputations worldwide, next to Sweden. In this survey the UK did not fare as well, although it still ranked within the top 20. In 2014 when the same set of respondents were asked about the countries they find most attractive for making personal contacts and friendships, the United States ranked highest. The UK followed again with 39 percent of respondents, ranking it the second most attractive in terms of both trustworthiness and making new friends. Favorable characteristics of UK residents included being polite/having good manners and being educated and skilled. Their worst characteristics included drinking too much alcohol and bad eating habits. Overall the United States ranked as the most attractive country in 2014, although opinions on attractiveness can vary depending on the factors taken into consideration. In the same survey, the leading characteristic contributing to a country’s attractiveness was its culture, followed by economy, natural environment and society.
