 Tourist arrivals at accommodation establishments in Croatia have been steadily rising each year since the start of the decade. In 2018, a record 18.6 million tourists (including residents and non-residents) arrived at accommodation in Croatia. Tourism in Croatia In line with trends across Europe, tourism in Croatia has experienced a boost in the last ten years. International tourists account for the vast majority of arrivals in accommodation in Croatia, and the country has maintained its popularity as a vacation destination for European and global visitors alike. With its array of coastal towns and resorts on the Adriatic Sea, it is a key destination for cruise tourism, especially the port of Dubrovnik. Tourism Dubrovnik has also intensified in part thanks to the HBO TV series Game of Thrones, which used the old town as a prominent filming location. To help tackle issues with overcrowding within the old town city walls, the city of Dubrovnik announced plans to coordinate the number of cruise calls and passengers entering the city. Hotel capacity in Croatia Increased tourism demand has had a positive impact on the hotel industry in Croatia and international investment in the sector is predicted to rise. The accommodation capacity has already shown signs of increasing, with a steady rise in hotel numbers and available bedspaces.
