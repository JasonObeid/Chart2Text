 This statistic shows the percentage changes in selected causes of death due to diseases in the U.S., between 2000 and 2017. The number of deaths caused by prostate cancer decreased by 1.9 percent during this period. Changes in selected causes of death There has been a decrease in the rate of death caused by many diseases, including breast cancer and heart disease. However, the mortality rate due to Alzheimer’s disease has increased by 145 percent from 2000 to 2017. Alzheimer’s disease caused 31 deaths per 100,000 population in 2017 and is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. It is expected that approximately 840,000 people aged 65 and older in California will have Alzheimer’s disease in 2025. Mortality rates due to different diseases also vary by ethnicity groups. Cancer, the leading cause of death among Asians and Pacific Islanders in the U.S., accounted for 26 percent of total deaths among this population, while heart disease was the leading cause of death among the white population. Globally, ischemic heart disease are the leading cause of death, accounting for some 17 percent of all deaths. In the early 1900's, mortality rate was primarily concentrated among people of younger ages, but increasingly, this has shifted to older population groups. In recent years, decreased mortality rates are often linked to improved medical care, such as new developments in medical technologies. Shifts in lifestyle habits such as decreased smoking rates and healthier diets may also be attributable to lower mortality rates.
