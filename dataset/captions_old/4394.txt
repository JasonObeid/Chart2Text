 Most U.S. solar installations require the use of imported panels, largely coming from Asia. About 45 percent of solar photovoltaic imports into the United States came from Malaysia between January and August 2019. About 58 percent of voters in the United States stated that they opposed imposing tariffs on these imported energy panels. Solar import tariffs In 2018, President Donald Trump tacked on duties of as much as 30 percent onto solar power products from outside of the domestic market. These safeguard tariffs were placed onto imported silicon solar cells and modules and will apply for four years. Previously in 2014, the International Trade Commission (ITC) had implemented restrictions on solar products manufactured in China and Taiwan to prevent dumping, and thus, the United States began to receive imports largely from Malaysia, South Korea, and Singapore. How is the solar market now? The solar tariffs have had an impact on the overall price of solar in the United States and the number of solar energy-related jobs after the initial trade complaint was filed in 2017. However, the solar energy industry in the United States continues to prosper in spite of the import tariffs placed on this renewable energy source.
