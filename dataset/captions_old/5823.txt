 In 2018, the migration balance in Belgium was roughly 50,000, meaning that the number of immigrants moving to Belgium outnumbered the number of people leaving the country by about 50,000. This was an increase in comparison to the previous year, but significantly lower than for example in 2010 and 2011, when the migration balance was 79,446 and 62,157 respectively. It was also considerably lower than in neighboring country the Netherlands, which in 2018 had a positive migration balance of over 86,000. Regional differences in Belgium Within Belgium, there were marked regional differences as well. The Flemish Region, the Dutch-speaking part of the country, had a migration balance of nearly 25,000 in 2018. By comparison, the migration balance of the French-speaking Walloon Region was roughly one third of this, at just over 8,000. Opinions on immigration in Belgium Between 2011 and 2018, Ipsos surveyed opinions on immigration in Belgium multiple times. The share of respondents who believe immigration has a positive impact on the country was continuously low though, never reaching above 16 percent. On a more positive note though, this peak was reached in the most recent survey, held at the end of 2018. Surveys from 2011 and 2013 saw considerable fewer positive responses of nine and eight percent respectively. After 2013, the share of respondents positive about immigration remained above ten percent in all years, until it reached its peak in 2018.
