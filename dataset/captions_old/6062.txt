 This statistic contains data on the revenue that WarnerMedia generated with its TV network business in 2018. In 2018, the media giant generated 10.58 billion U.S. dollars with, among others, HBO, CNN and Cartoon Network. Due to the acquisition of Time Warner by AT&T and its subsequent renaming (now WarnerMedia), results for previous years are not considered meaningful and as such were not reported by AT&T in 2018.
