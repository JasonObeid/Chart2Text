 This statistic depicts the recommended retail price (RRP) of a typical pack of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2005 to 2017. The price of cigarettes has substantially increased each year since 2000. In 2015, the recommended retail price of a 20 pack of cigarettes was 9.16 British pounds. As of 2017, the most expensive country in which to purchase cigarettes in Europe was the United Kingdom. Cigarette prices across Europe are driven by the respective taxes imposed within each of the member states and consist of a specific duty per 1,000 cigarettes and an ad valorem rate onto the recommended retail price, in addition to value added tax (VAT). Thus the highest rates of taxation are reflected in the retail prices. Similar rates of taxation between countries are also found for hand rolling tobacco, where the highest levels of taxation are found in the United Kingdom once again. Governments that impose such strong barriers to the purchasing of tobacco are considered 'nanny states', with high levels of control on other factors, such as advertising, bans of tobacco products on retail displays and graphic warnings on cigarette packs.
