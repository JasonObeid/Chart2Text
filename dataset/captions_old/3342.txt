 This statistic displays the results of a survey on the share of individuals in Great Britain who used the internet in order to make travel arrangements in 2019, by age and gender. The survey was conducted via interviews and gathered data from 1,800 households, providing a nationally representative sample of households in Great Britain. Households were sampled monthly and estimates are subject to sampling variability. Making travel arrangements online was most common among the 25 to 34 year old demographic, with 57 percent of individuals within this group having made travel arrangement purchases (eg transport tickets, car hire) online in 2019. The smallest proportion of people who did so was among people 65 years and older. A forecast of the digital travel sales worldwide predicts that online travel arrangement purchases will increase. Travel arrangements category was the fifth most popular type of goods and services purchased online in Great Britain in 2017.
