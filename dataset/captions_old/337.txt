 The postseason of the NFL is when things start to get really interesting – the knockout nature of the games with a place at the Super Bowl on the line means that the tension is ramped up. The New England Patriots seem to be unfazed by this added pressure as they have notched up an impressive 37 wins during the postseason, marking an NFL record. Playoff mainstays While the Patriots have notched up the most wins in NFL postseason history, it is the Dallas Cowboys who have made the most playoff appearances – their 33 appearances are just one more than the number of times the Green Bay Packers and the New York Giants have made it to the knockout stages. The New England Patriots, one of the most successful teams in NFL history, are surprisingly low down the list with 26 playoff appearances. This can be attributed to the fact that the Patriots only made it to 10 playoffs before the turn of the millennium. However, since the turn of the century, the New England franchise has made 16 appearances, only missing out in the 2002 and 2008 seasons. What caused this reversal of fortunes for the New England Patriots? The Patriots’ main man When you think of the New England Patriots in the last twenty years, you think of only one man – Tom Brady. The legendary quarterback has won a record 30 playoff games with the Patriots, almost double the number of wins of his closest quarterback rival, Joe Montana. Brady has been involved in every single one of the Patriots’ six Super Bowl wins, making him the first player in history to have won six Super Bowls. He also sits a very respectable fourth place on the list of players with the most passing yards in NFL history, behind only fellow legendary quarterbacks, Drew Brees, Peyton Manning, and Brett Favre.
