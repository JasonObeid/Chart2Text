 This statistic displays the annual exchange rate (average or standardized measure) of the euro to the Canadian dollar (EUR CAD), according to the data provided by the European Central Bank, starting from the introduction of the euro in 1999 up until the 2019. This is the average, or standardized, measure; it denotes a calculation of average based on many observations throughout the period in question. It is different to the concrete (point in time) measure. The second one is used to show the exchange rate as it looked like in a specific point in time, for example at end of the month or end of the year, at closing. Between years 2009 and 2012, the exchange rate noted a sharp decline in value, with the annual average exchange rate of the euro to the Canadian dollar falling 1.59 to 1.29 by 2012. This meant that one euro could buy 1.29 Canadian dollars. This sharp decline was most likely associated with the volatile changes brought to the financial markets by the global recession. Since 2012, the annual average euro to Canadian dollar exchange rate has recovered to the level of 1.49 as of 2019; however it remains to be lower, compared to 1999, the first year of the observation.
