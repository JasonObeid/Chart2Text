 Content marketing was believed to be the most effective digital technique based on the responses of global marketers in early 2018. When asked to identify the single activity they thought would make the largest commercial impact on their own or their clients’ businesses, 20 percent pointed to content marketing. Following that was artificial intelligence and machine learning, big data, and social media marketing. Why could AI be beneficial for marketing? Across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific artificial intelligence is most commonly used in marketing data analysis. There are some differences between the regions, however, where Asian marketers seem to be more experimental with the use of AI and employ the technology in content creation, whereas North American and European industry professionals tend to utilize AI for automation of marketing processes such as personalization, optimization or programmatic advertising. It falls in line with what marketers really expect from AI – making their tasks easier and improving marketing effectiveness. Among those who have already used artificial intelligence in their marketing efforts, the majority claim that AI helped them with better content recognition, increasing sales and customer relations as well as facilitating new product launches. As a result, the majority of marketers are expecting to increase spending on artificial intelligence related initiatives by up to 50 percent in the near future.
