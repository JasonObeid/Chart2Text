 Swedish appliance manufacturer Electrolux brought in around 14 billion U.S. dollars in revenue in 2018, marking the company’s highest total since 2002. The company has reported relatively stable revenue figures for the past few years with the overall number floating between 13.5 and 14 billion dollars. Electrolux Founded a century ago, Electrolux has grown into a major manufacturer of ovens, washing machines, refrigerators, and many other household appliances. The company generates the bulk of its revenue on the U.S. market, but also has significant businesses in Brazil, Germany, and its native Sweden. Major appliance sales are the company’s biggest earner by far, but Electrolux has also managed to maintain segments related to small domestic appliances, home care, and professional products. Household appliance industry The global household appliances market is highly competitive, with Chinese manufacturing giants Midea Group, Gree Electric, and Qingdao Haier leading the way in terms of sales. Given the massive appeal of appliances like refrigerators and ovens, there is space in the industry for many highly successful brands and manufacturers. The biggest non-Chinese brands are Electrolux and Whirlpool, which bring in a combined 35 billion dollars in sales each year.
