 This statistic displays the share of hot beverages consumed most often by individuals in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2015. Of respondents, 44 percent drink tea most often, followed by 21 percent who drink instant coffee. Hot drinks have always played an important role in British culture, particularly in the case of tea, as seen in the high and rising market value of hot drinks. Recently, however, the increasing popularity of coffee has dented sales of tea, turning Brits into a nation of coffee drinkers. This has been furthered exaggerated by cheaper and easier access to premium coffee via the likes of coffee pod machines. Tea is also making a new name for itself, however, with loose leaf tea, as well as fruit and herbal teas, appealing to the many that are improving their eating habits and following current health and wellness trends.
