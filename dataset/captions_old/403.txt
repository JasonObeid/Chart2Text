 In baseball terms, a home run is a hit that allows the batter to run all the way around the bases and reach home safely. Home runs are generally achieved when the ball is hit over the outfield without touching the ground first. In Major League Baseball, Barry Bonds leads the pack of all-time home run scorers. He hit a record 762 home runs in his career between 1986 and 2007, during which time he played for the Pittsburgh Pirates and the San Francisco Giants. MLB legends – Barry Bonds In no small part as a result of his outstanding home run record, Barry Bonds is considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time. It is therefore surprising that he is yet to be inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, although the San Francisco Giants did elect him to their Wall of Fame and retired the No. 25 jersey in his honor. Interestingly, Barry Bonds does not lead the list of all-time home runs scored for the San Francisco Giants – this accolade is held by Willie Mays, who is in sixth on the all-time league home run list. MLB legends – Babe Ruth One man who did make it into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and who is often called the greatest baseball player of all time is Babe Ruth. The Yankees Legend is top of the team’s all-time home run list, having smashed 659 home runs during his 14-year career in New York. Not only was the Yankees’ No. 3 shirt retired in his honor, but he was also inducted to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame, despite only playing for them for a comparatively short five years. Babe Ruth is second on the list of MLB all-time RBI (runs batted in) leaders, only behind Hank Aaron, who spent his whole career playing in Milwaukee. The player who appeared the most times overall in the MLB is Pete Rose, who played a total of 3,562 games in a career spanning 23 years.
