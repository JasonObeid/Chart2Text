 Cosmetics build a dynamic market in Europe. As displayed in the present statistic, the consumption value of cosmetics and personal care products reached 78.58 billion euros in 2018, adding on a growth of five percentage points over the past six-year period. Skin care: true hype The most dominant product group in the cosmetics market is reflective of a recent global hype: skin care. In Europe, the market value of skin care products made up about one-fifth of the entire cosmetic industry. Toiletries followed shortly behind skin care, whereas fragrances and perfumes had a comparatively low share in the market at about 12 percent. Germany loves a local brand One country that stands out in the vast landscape of European cosmetics is Germany. In 2018, cosmetics consumption in Germany was the greatest among other European countries. A detailed look at the favorite personal care products among Germans revealed that consumers had a penchant for homegrown products such as the Hamburg-based Nivea.
