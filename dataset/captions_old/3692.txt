 Scotland has seen its annual rainfall vary since 1994, but it usually received more than 1,500 millimeters (mm) of rain per year. However, in 2018 the recorded rainfall amounted to 1,395mm, which was the fourth lowest during this period. Rainfall peaked in 2011 at 1,886mm. As of 2019, rainfall reached 1,593mn Wet end to the year The wettest months in Scotland tend to be those at the end of each year, with December of 2015 recording higher than normal levels of rain at 328mm. That same month there was an average of 25.7 raindays. Raindays are defined as those where more than 1mm of rain falls. This was approximately 10 more days of rainfall compared to December 2018. Why is it so wet in Scotland? With its mountainous landscape, it is no coincidence that on average it is Scotland that receives the most annual rain in the UK. The wettest parts of the UK are generally in mountainous regions, with the Western Highlands prone to high levels of rain. Here, rainfall can be 3,000mm per year. However, the East of Scotland can see levels as low as 800mm. This is often due to rainfall from the Atlantic weather systems coming in from the West and as these systems move east, rain deposits reduce.
