How much is minimum wage? The federally mandated minimum wage in the United States is 7.25 U.S. dollars per hour, although the minimum wage varies from state to state. As of January 1, 2020, the District of Columbia had the highest minimum wage in the U.S., at 14 U.S. dollars per hour. This was followed by Washington state, which had 13.5 U.S. dollars per hour as the state minimum wage. Minimum wage workers Minimum wage jobs are traditionally seen as “starter jobs” in the U.S., or first jobs for teenagers and young adults, and the number of people working minimum wage jobs has decreased from almost four million in 1979 to about 434,000 in 2018. However, the number of workers earning less than minimum wage in 2018 was significantly higher, at almost 1.3 million. Minimum wage jobs Minimum wage jobs are primarily found in food preparation and serving occupations, as well as sales jobs (primarily in retail). Because minimum wage has not increased with inflation, and because the federal minimum wage has not been raised since 2009, it is becoming harder and harder for minimum wage workers to afford essential things like rent with one minimum wage job.
