 In its 2019 fiscal year, Canadian company BlackBerry recorded revenues of less than one billion U.S. dollars for only the second time in the past 15 years. The company, previously known as Research in Motion (RIM), has transitioned from developing BlackBerry brand smartphones to enterprise software and services involving the internet of things. Transitioning to the Enterprise of Things In the past decade, BlackBerry has seen a significant decline in their revenue figures and share of the global and U.S. smartphone market. Under the direction of John Chen, company CEO since 2013, BlackBerry Ltd. has withdrawn from the mobile phone market and began to focus primarily on providing software and security solutions to enterprises. Now, most of BlackBerry’s revenue comes from its enterprise software and services and BlackBerry Technology Solutions (BTS) business segments. Although it is still in the beginning stages of rebuilding profitability, Blackberry seems to be on a solid path rebuilding its core business as the estimated revenue growth for BlackBerry’s 2020 financial year is between 23 and 27 percent.
