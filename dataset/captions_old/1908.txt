 As of 2017, the states with the highest rates of abortion included New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Florida. As of that time, there were around 26 abortions per 1,000 women in the state of New York. The overall rate of legal abortions in the United States has gradually decreased since the mid-1980s. Facilities providing abortions Unsurprisingly, New York is also one of the states with the highest number of abortion-providing facilities in the U.S., with just over 250 such facilities. In recent years, many states have seen a decrease in the number of clinics that provide abortions. The largest decrease was seen in the state of Texas, where there were 46 such clinics in 2011 and just 21 in 2017. Public opinion Public opinion in the United States on the topic of abortion has fluctuated over the years. However, a survey from 2019 found that 49 percent of U.S. adults stated they were Pro-life, while 46 percent identified as Pro-choice. The same survey found that younger people were more likely to support abortion than the older generations.
