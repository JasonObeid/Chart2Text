 The average monthly housing rent in Italy in January 2020 was nearly 9.7 euros per square meter. However, this figure differed significantly according to the region in which the rental was looked for. In Aosta Valley, the tiniest region in the country which borders France and Switzerland, the average housing rent in December 2018 peaked at over 20 euros per square meter. Whereas in Calabria, the region that registered the lowest value, it amounted to approximately five euros per square meter. City vs. Countryside It is not a secret that rental prices for residential real estate differ hugely between the city and the countryside. Not only, among cities prices are also very different. In Italy, Milan and Rome are among the most expensive areas where to rent a dwelling. According to data gathered in 2018, some districts of the two cities boasted an average rental price of over 20 euros per square meter. Southern Italy is more affordable In absolute terms, renting a dwelling in cities in southern Italy is more affordable. Even in the most affluent areas, rents in Palermo were not higher than 8.3 euros per square meter in December 2018. Moreover, in Naples renting a dwelling could cost as much as 15.5 euros per square meters in the affluent districts of Chiaia and Mergellina.
