 Cotton production in the United States fluctuates significantly from year to year. In 2019, around 20.1 million bales of cotton were produced in the United States, a drop from 18.4 million bales in the previous year. Leading States for cotton production Historically, much of the cotton in the United States has been grown in the Southern states, and this trend continues to this day. Texas had a cotton production volume of about 6.94 million bales in 2018, making that state the top producer of cotton in the United States. Texas produced several times more than the second leading producer of cotton, Georgia. In that year, Georgia produced around 1.95 million bales of cotton. Genetically modified cotton Compared to other crops like genetically modified corn and soybeans, the acreage of genetically modified cotton is relatively low in the United States. However, between 2015 and 2017 the area planted with GM cotton in the U.S. has been creeping. One of the most common types of genetically modified cotton is herbicide resistant cotton, which can survive being sprayed with herbicides while surrounding weeds are destroyed
