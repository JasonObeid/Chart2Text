Dollar store controversy Following the 2008 recession, Dollar General expanded rapidly, primarily in economically depressed areas. The company, along with other major dollar store chains, claimed to fill a niche in these communities where the closest grocery store might either be too far or have prices too high for customers. Critics say dollar stores are driving out full-service grocery stores and local businesses, exacerbating economic decline and offering a narrow selection of food with lower nutritional value. Groceries lead sales Looking at the merchandise sales of Dollar General, it is indeed the consumables category that is the company’s biggest earner, and its sales are outpacing the rest of the company’s offerings. In 2009, consumables accounted for 70 percent of sales, in 2018 that share had risen to 77 percent.
