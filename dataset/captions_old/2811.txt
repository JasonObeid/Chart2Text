 Worldwide industrial robot shipments increased by one percent from about 382,000 in 2017 to around 384,000 in 2018. Global spending on industrial robots is projected to exceed 24 billion U.S. dollars by 2025. Leading markets Japan, China, the United States, South Korea, and Germany are counted among the five leading industrial robot markets worldwide. In emerging manufacturing markets, the growth trend is largely driven by rising wages that make the use of machines appear a viable alternative to human labor. Leading applications for industrial robots Industrial robots can be deployed for a wide range of tasks in a growing number of industries. Although the highly automated car manufacturing sector remains the largest area of application for electro-mechanical machines, industrial robots are continuously making their way into other areas such as the food and beverages industry. It has to be noted that the field of robotics is a part of another industry: the automation market. This industry is comprised of a variety of products and services, including relays, switches, sensors and drives, machine vision and control systems, as well as industry software development and services. Conglomerates like Siemens, Mitsubishi Electric or General Electric are the major vendors of industrial automation and industry software. The key players in the industrial robot market include ABB, KUKA, Fanuc, Kawasaki, and Yaskawa.
