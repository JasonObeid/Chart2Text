 This statistic shows the average number of recipients of Arbeitslosengeld II (ALG II) in Germany from 2012 to 2020. In 2019, 3,896,044 people received ALG II on average. ALG II, also called Hartz IV, means social benefit payments to people without an income who cannot work to make a living. Whether or not a claimant is eligible for Arbeitslosengeld II depends on his or her assets, savings, life insurance and the income of spouse or partner. If all of these assets are below a threshold level, a claimant can get money from the state.
