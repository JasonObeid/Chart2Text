 The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional cricket league which was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India in 2008. The professional Twenty20 tournament has changed the entire demographics of the game which now integrates the entertainment industry as well. The tournament has the highest attendance amongst all cricket leagues in the world, which in turn brings a lot of revenue in the sector. The handshake with the advertising and entertainment industry became evident in the high franchise value of the teams. The average annual player salary of a Kolkata Knight Riders player in the 2017 season was over 5.3 million U.S. dollars. Loyalty to the league The devotion to the game comes on and off the pitch. The teams are actively followed on all social networking platforms. Combined, the IPL teams recorded over 50 million likes on Facebook and had a follower base of more than 80 million on Twitter. New relationships The sports industry in the south Asian country has witnessed a leap over the last few years. The country seems to have moved on from the times when the word ‘sport’ was equivalent to just cricket. Sports like football, kabaddi, badminton and others are gaining more popularity and viewership. The IPL model has been replicated and applied to other sports. Fantasy sports are also catching up fast to physical ones. The new domain has opened new possibilities for people to engage into the industry from a different angle. With the help of increased internet penetration and awareness, the sports industry across the nation is likely to flourish in the coming future.
