 This statistic represents the leading countries in biofuel production in 2018. In Germany, production reached around 3.4 million metric tons of oil equivalent that year. That means, Germany is among the global top three countries in biofuel production. The volume of biodiesel production in the United States can be found here. Biofuel production in the U.S.Biofuels are characterized by fuels that obtain their energy through the process of biological carbon fixation. These hydrocarbons are made by or from living organisms in a relatively short period of time - in comparison to the formation of fossil fuels which requires millions of years. The United States was by far one of the largest producers of biofuel in the world in 2018, accounting for 39.9 percent of global biofuel production. The country produced 35 million metric tons of oil equivalents in this year, while Brazil produced 22.4 million metric tons of oil equivalents. Global biofuel production has gradually increased from 9.2 million metric tons of oil equivalents in 2000 to 95.37 million metric tons of oil equivalents in 2018. Biofuels are commonly used as part of mixtures with fossil fuel sources or as additives. One of the largest consumers of biofuels in the U.S. is the national army. Many vehicles can be fueled using blends containing up to 10 percent ethanol. In the beginning of the 20th century, many Ford T models were fueled with ethanol. Biofuels can also be generated through the consumption or conversion of biomass material. This conversion can occur thermally, chemically, or biochemically. Biomass consumption in the United States totaled 5,196 trillion British thermal units in 2018.
