 In 2018, the urban population in Malaysia was approximately 24.4 million. In the years since 2005, the urban population in Malaysia had been steadily increasing, and as is in line with global trends, it is projected to increase further in the future. Rapid urbanization In 2017, approximately 75 percent of Malaysia’s population lived in urban areas and cities. This puts Malaysia as one of Southeast Asia’s most urbanized countries. The metropolitan area of Greater Kuala Lumpur had a population of more than seven million in that year, making it Malaysia’s biggest urban area. However, about twice as many Malaysians lived in cities with half a million inhabitants or less. Urban-rural divide For many Malaysians, urbanization brought about more and better economic opportunities and job prospects. The average monthly income for urban households was more than three thousand ringgit higher than that of rural households. Poverty rates in rural areas were also significantly higher than that in urban areas. Even so, the countryside still holds a nostalgic place in the hearts of Malaysians, encapsulated in the romanticized idea of the ‘kampung’ or Malay village.
