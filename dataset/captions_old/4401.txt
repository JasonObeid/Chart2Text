 In 2018, around 275 terawatt hours of wind electricity were generated in the United States. That year, wind power was by far the largest non-hydroelectric renewable energy source used in the United States, followed by solar and thermal. Clean energy on the rise The highest increase in clean energy investments came in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Since then, investments in clean energy have continued to grow, but more slowly and inconsistently. Nevertheless, larger investments in clean energy in the past decade have brought higher generation of wind and solar power. The sharpest rise in wind power generation came in 2008, while solar power generation saw a much larger increase around 2013, its most substantial rise before progressing at smaller intervals again. The globalized U.S. wind market Based in Copenhagen, the Danish company Vestas holds a large portion of the global wind manufacturer market share. Vestas electricity deliveries were the highest to the United States. Though the United States has generated increasing amounts of wind power, the U.S. continues to source much of its wind power turbines and equipment from international companies such as Vestas.
