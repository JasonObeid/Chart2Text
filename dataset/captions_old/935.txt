 The statistic ranks the pro male tennis players according to the number of aces served in 2016. John Isner leads all players with a total of 1,159 aces in 50 matches. Most aces in 2015 - additional information In tennis an ace is a legal serve that is not touched by the receiver, thus winning the point for the server. Aces generally occur on a player’s first serve where the server can hit the ball with maximum force and accurate placement. There are several types of aces, including a hard flat serve to either the middle or the corner of the service box and a spin serve out wide. The American John Isner holds the record for the most aces in a single match. He hit 112 aces in a match against Nicolas Mahut (who himself hit 103) in the first round of Wimbledon in 2010. This match was the longest ever played both in terms of time taken (11 hours and 5 minutes) and number of games (183). Second on the list is Milos Raonic, who broke into the top 10 of the ATP Rankings for the first time in 2013 after reaching the fourth round of the Australian Open and the third round of the French Open where he lost to Kevin Anderson (third on the list). Goran Ivanišević holds the record for most aces served in a year with 1,477 in the 1996 season, as well as recording the most aces in a single tournament when he hit 213 on the way to winning Wimbledon in 2001. The fastest ace recorded was by Samuel Groth in 2012 at an ATP Challenger event where he hit a serve at 263km/h. However the ATP does not formally recognize this record and so the official record for the fastest serve is held by Ivo Karlovic with a serve of 251 km/h at the 2011 Davis Cup. Sam Querrey holds the record for consecutive aces with 10 against James Blake in the quarter final at the 2007 Indianapolis Tennis Championships.
