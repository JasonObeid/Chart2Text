In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2019, Microsoft's online gaming service had 65 million monthly active users, up from just under 40 million at the beginning of 2016. Xbox Live perks Xbox Live is available as a free service, but it also has paid tiers known as Xbox Live Silver and Xbox Live Gold. Many of the key features that gamers look for in the service, such as online gaming and access to exclusive games, are restricted to the Gold service. The Gold service also includes a Games with Gold program, in which gamers are offered access to digital downloads of games every month. Xbox One gamers have access to two games every month, with the cumulative retail value of these games reaching a combined 850 U.S. dollars throughout 2018. King of the consoles? Since its release in November 2013, the Xbox One console, seen as the successor to the beloved Xbox 360, has sold over 42 million units worldwide. The console has sold particularly well in the United States, with the country accounting for over half of the global sales of the Microsoft machine. However, the Xbox One still has some way to go to catch up with its old rival, Sony’s PlayStation. Sales of the PlayStation 4 are slowly creeping towards the 100 million mark in 2019, far surpassing those of the Xbox One. Moreover, after the flop of the WiiU, Nintendo is also staking its claim once more as a console giant - sales of its newest console, the Nintendo Switch, are rapidly on the rise. It seems that Microsoft has a fight on its hands in the struggle for console supremacy.
