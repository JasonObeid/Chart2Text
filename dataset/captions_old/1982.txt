U.S. Chemical Industry The chemical industry is among the largest manufacturing industries within the U.S. The industry is also responsible for a large proportion of the world’s chemical shipments. The value of U.S. chemical exports has seen values increasing over time but has recently encountered a sharp decline in value as of 2017. Trade conflicts with countries such as China are likely one of the factors causing the decline. Canada, Mexico, and China are among the leading consumers of U.S. chemical exports.
