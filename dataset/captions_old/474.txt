 This statistic shows the highest-grossing actors of all time in the United States, as of September 2019, ranked by their domestic box office results. Owing mostly to his role as Han Solo in the Star Wars franchise, and his role as the eponymous hero in the Indiana Jones series of films, Harrison Ford is fourth in the list with a lifetime domestic box office revenue of approximately 5.12 billion U.S. dollars. The highest actress on the list is Scarlett Johannsson, who ranked third, with a lifetime gross of over 5.24 billion U.S. dollars. This is largely due to her role as the Black Widow in the commercially-successful Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise.
