 Singapore posted a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 3.7 percent in 2017, after adjusting for inflation. While up from the previous two years, this number is expected to decline in 2018, settling around 3.14 percent. What is GDP? GDP is a measure of a country’s income, and most economists agree that slow but steady GDP growth is best for a developed economy. GDP measures the total value of all goods and services produced within a country during a certain time period. With the highest GDP per capita in ASEAN, Singapore certainly qualifies as developed, meaning that it should target GDP growth around 2 to 3 percent. Singapore’s context Singapore is a small, open economy. As such, it has little influence on, and high exposure to, international trends. For example, a shift in the exchange rate with a major trading partner can have significant effects on the economy. For Singapore, who relies heavily on exports, these kinds of shocks can affect the entire economy. For example, a weaker Singapore dollar would increase GDP by raising net exports, but this would also lead to higher inflation. As a result, policymakers in Singapore have to follow many factors if they want to continue enjoying healthy GDP growth.
