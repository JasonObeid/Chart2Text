 According to a survey conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the number of hospitals in France steadily decreased between the years 2000 and 2012, going from 3,120 to 2,657 within twelve years. Nevertheless, this trend was abruptly reverted during the first year of the Hollande Presidency: the number of hospitals jumped from 2,657 in 2012 to 3,192 in 2013. The number of Public Hospitals in France have increased during Hollande’s presidency During the first year of the former French president François Hollande Presidency, the number of publicly owned hospitals in France also increased at an abrupt pace, going from 928 in 2012 to 1,458 hospitals in 2013. However, the number of individuals employed in the public health system or in all hospitals increased only slightly during the first three years of Hollande’s Presidency, going from around 1,298 thousand employees in 2013 to 1.3 million in 2015. The French Public Health System covers much of the per capita health expenses In 2019, the French Health System accounted for a small fraction of the public budget. In fact, only around 1,4 billion euros were destined to public health, compared to 44 billion euros allocated to for Defense. Yet, the health spending per capita in France is one of the highest among other develop countries. According to 2016 figures, around 4,600 U.S. dollars were spent per person in healthcare, of which 3,626 U.S. dollars were covered by the public health system.
