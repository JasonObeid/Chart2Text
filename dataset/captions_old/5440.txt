 This statistic shows the results of a 2018 survey regarding patriotism in the United States. The respondents were asked how proud they are to be an American. In 2018, some 47 percent of survey respondents stated they were extremely proud to be an American. American patriotism 81 percent of the American population seems to be very to extremely proud to be American, and they aren't shy to show it off: Around 60 percent of the population owns an American flag and around 44 percent own apparel branding patriotic imagery or symbols. Interestingly, patriotism seems to span the generations as well, with Millennials being only slightly less patriotic than the Gen X'ers or even the Baby Boomers. Ingrained patriotism is also one of the reasons why so many American men have chosen to fight in wars throughout history, and more than 80 percent of adults between the ages of 85 and 90 are now veterans. The number of veteran men under age 55 is noticeably lower, by the way, even though patriotism is alive and well and the U.S. is still sending soldiers to war zones. While Americans are overwhelmingly proud to be American, it is also worthwhile to see how the public opinion of the United States varies across different regions and countries of the world: While the United States enjoys a fairly favorable standing in Africa, for example, only a third of the Middle Eastern population views the United States favorably, most likely due to its controversial military involvement in the region.
