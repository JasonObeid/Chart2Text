 Spain edged ahead of Italy to become the world’s top exporter of wine in 2018. The country shipped 21 million hectoliters of the beverage in that year, compared to Italy’s 19.7 million and France’s 14.1 million. 2018 was also a peak year for wine production worldwide. Overall, 292.3 million hectoliters of wine were produced compared to 249.8 million in 2017. Spanish wine Despite having the most area of land utilized for wine production in the world, Spain is the third overall wine producer by volume. In 2018, the country produced 44.4 million hectoliters, compared to production leader Italy’s 54.8. This discrepancy is due, at least in part, to the low yields of Spanish vines which are often planted in relatively dry and infertile soil. Imports Of the top three exporters, only France ranks in the top ten of wine importing countries, receiving 6.2 million hectoliters=, at value of 861 million Euros in 2018.
