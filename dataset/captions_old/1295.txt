 In December 2019, singer-songwriter Angèle had the most followers of all Belgian influencers on Instagram. This according to data provided by InfluencerDB. The musician had several hit songs in 2018, including number one hit Tout Oublier in Belgium and France with her brother Romeo Elvis (fourth in this ranking). Most influencers in this ranking are either active in music (such as rapper Roméo Elvis and DJ Amelie Lens) or in fashion, like Matthias Geerts and Chloé Kitembo. Gaëlle Garcia Diaz (sixth in the ranking) and fellow-vlogger and actor Jimmy Labeeu (in second) were married to each other for several years. Instagram users in Belgium were typically women, aged 18 to 24 years old, which could be a potential explanation for these interests. Instagram is popular in Belgium but not as popular as in the rest of Europe… Instagram had three million active users in Belgium. When compared to the rest of Europe, though, Belgium did not rank among the leading countries when it comes to the use of the photo app. The share of the Belgian population that used Instagram was lower than, for example, that of Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and its neighbors Luxembourg and the Netherlands. … but Belgian teenagers increasingly use it In a 2018 survey among teenagers from Flanders (the northern, Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), Instagram was said to be the third most used app Facebook and Snapchat. Compared to the same survey held in 2016, however, the application saw the biggest increase of all social media platforms.
