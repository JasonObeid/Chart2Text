 In 2018, 63 percent of same-day package deliveries in the United States were for business to consumer (B2C) parcels. The remaining market share was split between business to business (B2B) and consumer to consumer (C2C) deliveries. B2C e-commerce The size of the B2C parcel delivery segment is likely attributable to online retailing. Over the 2010’s, e-commerce has been rapidly growing its share of U.S. retail sales, increasing the demand for express package delivery. To differentiate themselves and meet consumer demand, many online retailers offer same-day shipping services. Amazon’s Prime is the most notable such service, with over half of all U.S. Amazon users having a Prime membership as of June 2019. E-commerce by segments E-commerce likely also has an effect on the C2C same-day delivery market. Online platforms such as eBay, Craigslist and even Facebook, provide popular services for C2C transactions. The impact is less significant on the B2B market though, with e-commerce only expected to account for 13.1 percent of B2B sales by 2021.
