 This statistic shows the monthly amount of cars sold by Alfa Romeo in the United Kingdom (UK) between July 2016 and December 2019. Peaks in registration numbers were recorded in March and September of each year, which was due to the issuing of license plates by the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in those months. In July 2019, 235 new Alfa Romeo units had been sold, a decrease of roughly ten percent in comparison to 261 units as of July 2018.
