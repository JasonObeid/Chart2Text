 Gross domestic product (GDP) of Malaysia grew 4.74 percent in 2018 and was forecast to remain slightly below 5 percent for the medium term. This means that the Malaysian economy will double in size in approximately 15 years, according to the trend. What affects GDP? GDP is the sum of spending in a country by consumers, investors, and the government, plus net exports. High GDP growth is associated with low unemployment, because a growing economy demands a growing labor force. There are also inflationary pressures, but responsible monetary and fiscal policy can keep the inflation rate low. GDP and development Developmental economists focus more on GDP per capita than GDP. Looking at how much each member of the economy generates gives a general idea of the level of development, with strong correlations between this and other development indicators. If population growth is faster than GDP growth, residents in the country will be worse off, in spite of a growing economy.
