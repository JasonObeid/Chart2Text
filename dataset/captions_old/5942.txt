 In the period of consideration, the total monthly hours of sunlight in the UK followed a similar pattern each year. The most notable change occurred in 2018, when the hours of sunlight shot up in May, June and July to 246, 240 and 238 hours respectively. Unsurprisingly it was the end of each year when sunlight hours were lowest. Little sunshine throughout the day The average annual number of daily sun hours has seen little change since the turn of the century, with the lowest average number being recorded in 2012 at 4 hours and the highest average being 4.9 in 2003. Instruments such as the Campbell-Stokes sunshine recorder are used to measure sunshine duration. However, more modern equipment is now being used as the Campbell-Stokes recorder overestimates sunshine duration. England gets the most sunshine Although sunshine is not a common sight throughout the United Kingdom, on average England receives the most monthly hours. Since 2014, the longest monthly duration of sunlight was recorded in June 2018, at an average of 248.5 hours. In comparison, Scotland received just 220 hours of sunshine in the same month.
