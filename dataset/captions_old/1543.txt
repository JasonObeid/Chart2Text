 In 2018, global stainless steel production was measured around 50.7 million metric tons. This figure has increased significantly over the course of the past decade, when the yearly global stainless steel production was well below 30 million metric tons. Stainless steel is an iron alloy that is resistant to stains or rusts due to a high level of chromium. Global steel industry Stainless steel is used in a variety of industries including construction, automobile assembly, chemical processing, piping and pollution control, to name a few. Globally, the North American Federal Trade Agreement (NAFTA) states and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) have seen the largest increase in not just stainless but overall steel use in recent years. Stainless steel in the U.S. The U.S. accounts for a small percentage of the global stainless steel production; however, the production of stainless steel in the U.S. has increased in recent years as well. That said, the U.S. and other NAFTA countries also continue to rely on stainless steel imports to meet demand. Regionally, most of the stainless steel imported to NAFTA countries comes from Asia and Western Europe.
