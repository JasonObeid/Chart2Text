 As of February 26, there was one mass shootings in the United States in 2020. This is compared to one mass shooting in 1982, one in 2000, and 12 mass shootings in 2018. School shootings The United States sees the most school shootings in the world. Some motivations for school shootings included depression, seeking revenge, and bullying. As a result of the large amount of school shootings, gun control has become a central topic in U.S. politics. This widespread problem happens across the United States; however California saw the highest number of K-12 school shootings in the United States since 1970. However, the deadliest school shooting (as of May 2019) was the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. This tragedy left 33 dead and 17 injured. Mass shooting issues Mass shootings happen when there are several injuries or deaths from a firearm-related violence. Throughout the last century, mass shootings have become an epidemic in the United States. However, despite the increase in mass shootings and number of casualties, the U.S. government has done little to prevent future shootings from happening. As a result of the lack of cooperation in politics, mass shootings have become the most common political issue that Generation Z is stressed about as of 2018. Furthermore, the right to bear arms is a popular belief in the U.S., although the percentage of households in the United States owning at least one firearm has remained somewhat steady since 1972.
