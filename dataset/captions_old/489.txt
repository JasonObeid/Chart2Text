The global cosmetics industry is broken down into six main categories; skin care being the largest one out of them all, accounting for 36.4 percent of the global market in 2016. In recent years, consumers have been spending higher levels of disposable income on cosmetics than they had in the past.

However, in recent years as Generation Y has really entered the job market, they have become a big driver of the cosmetics market; especially in the United States. The United States is the biggest cosmetic market in the world, with an estimated total revenue of about 62.46 billion U.S. dollars and employing about 63,816 people by 2016. In the coming years, global cosmetic companies will continue to focus their efforts on product innovation in order to attract new consumers and keep existing consumers loyal to specific brands.
