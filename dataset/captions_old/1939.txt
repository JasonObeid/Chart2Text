 This statistic shows the inflation rate in Germany from 1992 to 2019. In 2019, the inflation rate in Germany was at 1.4 percent. The inflation rate is calculated using the price increase of a product basket defined by the German Federal Statistical Office. This product basket contains products and services, on which the average consumer spends money throughout the year. They include expenses for groceries, clothes, rent, power, telecommunications, recreational activities and raw materials (e.g. gas, oil), as well as federal fees and taxes. The term inflation means the devaluation of money caused by a permanent increase of the price level for products (consumer goods , investment goods). The Consumer Price Index shows the price development for private expenses and shows the current level of inflation when increasing.
