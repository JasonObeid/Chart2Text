 The United States was the leading country for exports from the United Kingdom, with 15.8 percent of all UK exports going to this market. Germany was the second largest export market for the UK in this year, followed by the Netherlands, with these countries accounting for 10.4 percent and 7.6 percent of UK exports respectively. UK imports most from Germany Although the United States was the largest export market, Germany was the country from which the UK imported the highest share of goods, with 13.9 percent of the UK’s imports coming from its European neighbor. China was the second most important source of imports for the UK, with nine percent coming from there in 2018. European Single Market still the UK’s biggest market As of 2018, the European Single Market remains the largest trade partner for the United Kingdom, with around half of UK exports going there, and almost 60 percent of UK imports originating there. This may of course change in the future after the UK leaves the single market following the Brexit referendum of 2016.
