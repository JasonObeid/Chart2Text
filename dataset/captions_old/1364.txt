 In 2018, GDP per capita in Vietnam amounted to around 2,551 U.S. dollars. GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a year. It is considered to be a very important indicator of the economic strength of a country and a positive change is an indicator of economic growth. Vietnam’s economy In the last decade, the Vietnamese economy has experienced consistent economic growth with a six to seven percent increase in GDP from year to year. The country’s economy is fueled by its exports of natural resources and agricultural products, though since 2008 its information technology hardware exports have risen substantially. Vietnam’s agriculture and service sectors generate over 56 percent of Vietnam’s gross domestic product. Vietnam’s population The majority of Vietnam’s population works in the agriculture or service industries, and the country has one of the world’s lowest unemployment rates at just 1.8 percent in 2018. The population is relatively young, with the median age expected to reach 32.5 years by 2020. The median age has increased significantly from its low point of 18.2 years in 1970, around the time Vietnam was being devastated by war. Since then, the country’s population has increased as well, reaching over 94 million people in 2018.
