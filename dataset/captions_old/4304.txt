 The Kingdom of the Netherlands consists of the Netherlands and six Caribbean islands, that have either autonomous country status or are considered a special municipality of the Netherlands. Three islands are autonomous countries, the three others are special municipalities. The three special municipalities are Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, and together they form the Caribbean Netherlands. In 2019, roughly 25,200 people lived in the Caribbean Netherlands. The largest of the three municipalities is Bonaire, which was home to the large majority of the people living in the Caribbean Netherlands, at just over 20,000. Saba and Sint Eustatius Saba and Sint Eustatius are the two other special municipalities in the Caribbean Netherlands. Of the three municipalities, Saba is the smallest, with less than 2,000 permanent inhabitants. Roughly 3,100 people lived on Sint Eustatius. Combined, the population of these three special municipalities is still smaller than that of any of the autonomous countries in the Caribbean though. Sint Maarten, Aruba and Curacao Next to Bonaire, Saba and Sint Eustatius, there are three other Caribbean islands. These islands have the status of independent country, although they are still considered part of the larger Kingdom of the Netherlands. Of these autonomous countries, Curaçao is the largest, with roughly 160,000 inhabitants in 2018. Aruba followed, with a population of just over 111,000 in 2017. Of the autonomous countries, Sint Maarten is the smallest, with approximately 40,500 people in 2017.
