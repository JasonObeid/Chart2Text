Up until January 2019, Kylie Jenner's first photo of her daughter Stormi was the most liked post on Instagram and still ranks second among the top posts with 18.7 million likes. However, the first spot on the ranking is claimed by the Instagram egg, a picture of an egg posted by the account @world_record_egg. As of November 2019, the photo generated 53.9 million likes. A month later, the Instagram egg was revealed to promote a mental health campaign.
