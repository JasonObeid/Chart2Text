 The United States was the world’s most valuable nation brand by a distance in 2019, with a value of 27.8 trillion U.S. dollars. To give this figure some context, China was second in the ranking valued at 19.5 trillion U.S. dollars, substantially lower in value than that of the United States. Many of the world’s most valuable brands come from the United States. Nation brand value The impact of a country’s national image on a country’s economy and the brands based in the country cannot be understated. A good national image can bring many positives such as encouraging investment from outside of the country, adding value to a country’s exports, as well as attracting tourists and skilled migrants to the country. On the other hand, a country may incur significant economic damage from poor nation brand management or global events. U.S. companies dominate global retail The evidence of the impact of a nation’s brand value can be seen in the retail industry. As a result of globalization and various trade agreements between markets and countries, many retailers are capable of doing business on a global scale. As such, the national image associated with the brand’s home market is important. Many of the world’s leading retailers are companies based in the United States, the world’s most valuable nation brand. Walmart and Amazon are examples of American retailers doing business around the world. The success of U.S. retailers can also be seen through their performance in online retail. Amazon is a prime example of this, with the company’s sales revenue flourishing over the previous years.
