 In 2018, The New York Times Company stated in its 10-K report that it had 4,320 full-time equivalent employees in the United States. After a sharp drop in employee numbers between 2012 and 2013 due to the company’s sale of New England Media Group, there were just 3,529 people working The NYT Company, but the figure has grown more or less consistently year on year ever since. The New York Times Company’s assets The company has various media properties, including namesake newspaper The New York Times and its website NYTimes.com, as well as The New York Times Magazine, Book Review, Style Magazine and International Edition. Other assets include product review site Wirecutter and social media marketing firm HelloSociety. The company’s newspaper is arguably its most famous and most successful asset. The New York Times has won 125 Pulitzer Prizes and is widely read in and outside of the United States. As readers have moved away from print and towards digital, the company chose to capitalize on this. In early 2014, The New York Times Company’s digital-only news product had fewer than 800 thousand U.S. subscribers, but five years boasts almost three million paid users. The fact that many print-only publications are struggling to retain existing subscribers or appeal to new ones aptly proves that The New York Times Company made its move at the right time. Now, NYTimes.com regularly attracts millions of unique visitors each month, and the company also boasts well over 250 million U.S. dollars in print and digital circulation revenue.
