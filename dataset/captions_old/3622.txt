Mothers aged 20 to 34 years have the highest birth rate among all mothers in the U.S. Likewise, mothers of Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander origin had higher birth rates than mothers of other ethnicities. Family size and income also have an impact on birth rate. Households with an income under 10,000 U.S. dollars have a higher birth rate than higher household income brackets.
