 The statistic shows the global death toll due to earthquakes from 2000 to 2015. Around 9,624 people died worldwide in 2015 as a result of earthquakes. Earthquakes Earthquakes are typically caused by the movement of the earth crusts. These movements cause vibrations which pass through and around the world. Earthquake Early Warning systems use seismic networks to detect earthquakes very rapidly so that these warnings can protect peoples' lives. Nevertheless, an earthquake may cause injury and death. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, over 316,000 people were killed in the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. With a total number of 3,000 killed people, the earthquake in San Francisco on April 18, 1906 is the earthquake that caused the most fatalities within the United States. The number of fatalities includes people killed by earthquakes and resulting fires in San Francisco. The global number of deaths due to earthquakes varies from year to year. In 2010, about 320,120 people died as a result of earthquakes worldwide. In 2012 earthquakes only caused 768 fatalities. The world’s strongest earthquake in the time period from 1990 and 2013, according to measurement in the Richter scale, was the earthquake in Chile in 1960. With a magnitude of 9.5 this earthquake is the highest ranked earthquake. The Richter scale helps to quantify the energy released by an earthquake. The magnitude of 9.0 and higher is defined as ‘Near or at total destruction - severe damage or collapse to all buildings. Heavy damage and shaking extends to distant locations. Permanent changes in ground topography. Death toll usually over 50,000.’
