 This statistic shows the unemployment rate in France from 1999 to 2019. In 2019, the unemployment rate in France was around 9.1 percent. Population of France A member of the Group 7 and G20, France is one of the worlds most powerful, advanced and emerging economies. With a total population of around 64 million people, France’s economy must adapt itself to employ the growing population. Although the rates of the population growth in the past 5 years have declined in comparison to the population growth rates between 2003 and 2007, there is still an overall growth in the total population. An important factor which directly affects the French economy is the percentage increase in of people who are 65 years of age or older and percentage decline of people between the ages of 15 and 64 years. Due to the fact that the percentage of the working population is decreasing, mainly people between the ages of 15 and 64 years, and the median age of the population in France is increasing, the economy must adapt to the growing competition by providing more employment opportunities. With the Eurozone crisis and global financial crisis of 2008, the real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate in France suffered dramatic drops between 2008 and 2009 in comparison to the previous year. Despite having increased between 2009 and 2013, the employment in France has not reached the record high of 2008 again yet. In addition, the unemployment rates in the last decade have increased by almost 2 percent.
