 The population in Malaysia grew to 32.4 million people in 2018. This is in line with a steady positive trend that has been happening since at least 2014 and is forecast to continue until at least 2024, as well as with the growth rates in other ASEAN countries. Malaysian demographics As the fertility rate slowly declines, the population growth rate should slowly decline as well. However, since life expectancy is also slowly increasing, this can still fuel population growth, as we see in this statistic. In Malaysia, this is leading to a healthy age structure, with a large group of working-age people who are able to support a smaller number of old and young people. Economic effects A growing population should lead to an increasing gross domestic product (GDP), simply because more people means more consumers and workers. This is especially effective if the country is at full employment. Given the generally low level of unemployment in Malaysia, it is fairly safe to assume that this is true.
