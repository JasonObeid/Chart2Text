 Over the past decade the turnover from off-course horse race betting in the United Kingdom (UK) has significantly decreased from 5.74 billion British pounds in 2009 to 4.22 billion in 2019. A similar trend can be seen with off course dog race betting. Despite a slight decrease, the number of betting shops still held steady though, with William Hill and Ladbrokes making up roughly half of the shops. On-course betting also on the decline As the gambling trends in the UK shift more and more towards online gambling, also the turnover of on-course betting decreases. However the overall gross gambling yield (GGY) of the betting sector remains stable at roughly 3.25 billion British pounds in 2019. Remote gambling on the rise When looking at the entire GGY over time, the remote betting, bingo and casino sector quickly exploded onto the market and now accounts for the largest market share, reaching approximately 5.32 billion British pounds in 2019. In addition, the number of employees in the remote gambling sector rapidly increased as well.
