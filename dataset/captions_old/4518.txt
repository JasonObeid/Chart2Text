 In 2018, the infant mortality rate in the Netherlands was 3.5. This means that out of every 1,000 newborns, nearly four died before their first birthday. Infant mortality was lowest in 2015, when the rate was 3.3 deaths per 1,000 live born children. In total, nearly 170,000 babies were born in 2018. An infant mortality rate of 3.5 means that roughly 590 of these babies would not survive their first year. Steadily declining infant mortality Despite a slight increase in infant mortality in the last two years, medical developments have ensured a remarkable decrease in the number of children dying in their infancy. In 1950, out of every 1,000 live born babies nearly 27 would die in their first year. This was over seven times as high as today. Infant mortality in Western Europe The infant mortality rate in the Netherlands is comparable to other Western European countries. In the United Kingdom for example, the infant mortality rate was 3.9 in 2017, whereas France had a mortality rate of 3.6 in 2018. A slightly lower infant mortality was observed in neighboring Belgium, where the mortality rate was 3.1 in 2017.
