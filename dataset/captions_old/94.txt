 As of 2005, people in the United States stated that they have had an average of 10.7 sexual partners, which is slightly above the global average of nine sexual partners. Turkey in the lead? Surveys on sensitive or very personal topics, like sexuality, are often to be taken with a grain of salt, but in this case, Turkey did not only lead the ranking in 2005, it also topped the one conducted in 2010 on the mean number of sexual partners. So is it likely that the Turkish people are sexually more prolific than everybody else? Another survey by another source suggests otherwise: It does not include Turkey when it comes to the countries with the most sexually active inhabitants but lists the Greek as the most active ones. In general, people tend to embellish their own activities, but also those of others – the disparity between the perceived and the actual number of times people have sex is staggering and similar everywhere around the world. India the most monogamous? Of those countries surveyed, Indian respondents report the lowest average number of sexual partners, only slightly surpassed by China. Both China and India struggle with a significant difference between the number of men and the number of women, and both countries largely adhere to conservative standards of sexuality that prohibit sex before marriage.
