 This statistic shows the number of deaths per day by selected diseases in West African countries that are suffering from the Ebola outbreak in 2014. Malaria causes some 552 deaths per day in these countries, while Ebola causes around four deaths per day (as of August 2014). Ebola compared to other diseases Ebola first emerged in 1976 in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The 2014 outbreak in West Africa has proven difficult to control. Currently, there is no cure, however, treatment is available to maximize survival chances as well as minimize the potential for transmission. In August 2014, the World Health Organization has stated that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa had become an international health emergency. Ebola has caused four deaths per day in West Africa between December 2013 and August 11th, 2014. However, diseases such as malaria and HIV or AIDS have caused a significantly larger number of deaths daily in these countries, reaching 552 and 685 deaths per day in 2014, respectively. HIV/AIDS was responsible for some 1.5 million deaths in 2013 globally. As of 2013, there have been over 77 million cases of malaria in Africa and almost 7 million cases in the Eastern Mediterranean. Worldwide, malaria accounted for just under 90 million cases in 2013. Malaria is caused by a parasite which can be carried by mosquitoes and transmitted to humans. The parasite is then able to multiply within the liver and proceed to infect red blood cells. Common symptoms are fever, headache, and vomiting. Malaria can cause death if blood supply to vital organs is inhibited. The U.S. National Institute of Health and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation are among the leading funders for malaria research and development worldwide, contributing to 27.9 percent and 21.2 percent, respectively, between 2007 and 2012.
