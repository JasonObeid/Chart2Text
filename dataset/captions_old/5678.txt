 In 2018, Samsung was the brand with the highest Buzz score in the Netherlands, followed by two Dutch brands: food retailer Albert Heijn and Philips. A brand’s Buzz score indicates how positive a brand is perceived in a certain country. The survey tracks how many people have heard anything about a certain brand in the last two weeks, through advertising, news or word of mouth. Positive and negative answers are subtracted, and the higher the score, the better the brand’s evaluation in a country. Not just topping the ranking in the Netherlands, Samsung also did well in other countries. In the United States Samsung reached the 4th position in the ranking, and in Sweden and Denmark Samsung came in 6th and 10th position respectively. Media perception of Samsung in the Netherlands Adwired’s TheBrandTicker measures how brands are discussed in print, online and on social media. According to this tool, in the Netherlands Samsung was best-known for its quality, utility and innovation. Over one quarter of all media reports in 2018 spoke about Samsung’s quality in a positive way. By contrast, Samsung was less frequently discussed in relation to well-being and responsibility. Still, even with regard to these characteristics, coverage was more positive than negative. Media perception of Philips in the Netherlands and abroad Even more than Samsung, Philips was particularly highly regarded for its innovation. Over 16 percent of the media coverage in the Netherlands about the technology company analyzed Philips’ innovative qualities in a positive way. Philips also scored high on quality, convenience and popularity. The worldwide media perception of the brand is in line with this. Although global audiences rated Philips’ quality even higher than its innovation, Philips’ worldwide media perception also included a lot of positive coverage related to the company’s innovative capabilities.
