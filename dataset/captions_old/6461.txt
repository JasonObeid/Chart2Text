 This statistic presents the Gross Gaming Revenues (GGR) in selected European countries in 2018. Gross Gaming Revenues (GGR) The GGR is a key metric used within the gambling industry to refer to the difference between the amount of money received by a given agent, and the amount of money payed out by the agent. Sales revenue can be thought of as a comparable metric from outside the gambling industry.

Other comparably large GGRs were reported by regulated operators within the United Kingdom, German, France, and Spain. The GGR from regulated operators in Greece was 2.1 billion euros in 2018.
