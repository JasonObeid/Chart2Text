 The statistic shows the most used instant messaging services on mobile phones in the United Kingdom (UK) in 2013. In 2013, 50 percent of the respondents used Whatsapp most on their mobile phone. The second most common result is Facebook Messenger (42 percent). WhatsApp is a well established instant messaging service mostly used by mobile phone owners between the age of 18 and 29. However, all age groups are utilizing this messaging service at some level. Snapchat is definitely less popular than WhatsApp as can be seen in this statistic. However, still more than half of all 18 to 29 year olds are using Snapchat in the UK. Mobile messaging retail revenue of operators has seen a steady continuous decrease from 2010 to 2015. This is in direct correlation with the rising use of instant messaging services that run through the internet instead of through the mobile network operators.
