 This statistic shows the contribution of various euro-zone countries into the European Stability Mechanism (ESM). Germany contributes an enormous 27.1 percent of the scheme. The European Stability Mechanism (ESM), commonly referred to as the EU "rescue funding programme, was designed to stabilize the European economic and currency union and to avert "state bankruptcy" and any negative consequences to the common currency. It was planned due to debt overload of some of the individual member countries' budgets. The ESM is supposed to contain 620 billion euros of securities and 80 billion euros of cash deposits, and is supposed to be set up by 2013 at the latest.
