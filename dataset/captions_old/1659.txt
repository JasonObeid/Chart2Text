 Forecasts suggest that nearly 13.5 million microwave ovens will be shipped in the United States in 2019, marking the product’s highest sales figure in years. Although quite a mature market, microwave oven shipments have fluctuated significantly over the past few decades. Between 2005 and 2013 total shipments fell from around 13.9 million to 9.2 million per year; but in recent years the market has recovered to previous levels. Small household appliances The small household appliance industry to which microwave ovens belong generally includes household appliances with some degree of portability. Unlike refrigerators and washing machines, small household appliances tend to be countertop products that can be stored away when unneeded. As of 2017, the average American spent well over 100 dollars per year on small appliances such as microwaves, toasters, vacuums, and coffee makers. This 2017 average spending figure marked an all-time high. Electrolux, a leading home appliance company based in Stockholm, Sweden, recorded over 800 million dollars in small appliance net sales in 2018.
