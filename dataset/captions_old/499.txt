A strong-arm robbery involves the perpetrator using a weapon (either real or fake) in combination with a threat of force in order to rob someone. Decreasing crime As with most crime in the U.S., the number of robberies has decreased since 1990. Despite views that crime is on the rise in the United States, statistics show that the violent crime rate has almost halved in the last 30 years. The number of robberies in the U.S. have more than halved from their peak in 1991. What you seize is what you get Despite the classic idea of a bank robbery, robberies are far more likely to take place in the street or on a highway rather than in a bank. Additionally, the robbery rate was highest in the District of Columbia in 2018, and lowest in Vermont. For the entire United States, the robbery rate stood at 86.2 per 100,000 inhabitants in that same year.
