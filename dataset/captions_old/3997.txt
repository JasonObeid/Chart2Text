 The fertility rate in Sweden reached the lowest point in a ten-year period in 2019, when it was down to 1.7 children per woman. The fertility rate is defined as the number of children that would be born or are likely to be born to a woman if she lives to the end of her reproductive years. A similar decline was visible for the crude birth rate, which in 2019 was down at the lowest point since many years. More immigrants than emigrants Despite that the fertility rate and the crude birth rate in Sweden are at their lowest points, and have been declining for years, the population in Sweden continues to grow. More babies are born each year than people dying, which is a factor to a still growing population. The major reason behind a continued population growth though is the positive inflow of immigrants. Few Swedish citizens are leaving the country, while many more migrants are arriving to Sweden. The number of babies born is increasing Since the population is growing, the number of women in reproductive age are too, which may be a contributing a factor to more childbirths. The number of babies born over time is quite stable in Sweden, and around 115 thousand babies were born in 2019.
