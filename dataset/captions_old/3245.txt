 As of March 2, 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) had spread to six continents, and approximately 3,000 people had died after contracting the respiratory virus. The majority of the confirmed cases were located in China, where around 2,900 deaths had been reported. WHO raises global risk level Approximately 60 countries worldwide have been affected by the virus. The risk of infection is serious if you are in an area where there are confirmed cases, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has raised the global risk of the outbreak to very high. Most people can continue to go about their daily life as normal, but if you have recently traveled to an affected area or been in close contact with someone with the virus, you should seek medical advice and try to stay away from public places. What are the symptoms of the virus? It can take up to 14 days for symptoms of the illness to start being noticed. The most commonly reported symptoms are a fever and a dry cough, leading to shortness of breath. The early symptoms are similar to other viruses common at this time of year, such as the common cold and flu – these illnesses spread more during cold months, but it is not yet known whether or not temperature impacts the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Once again, medical advice should be sought if you are experiencing any of these symptoms.
