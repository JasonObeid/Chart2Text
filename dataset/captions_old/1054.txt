Those aged 65 or older had the lowest levels of consumption, with just 6.1 percent of respondents consuming cannabis in this time. Age related opinions on legalization Canada became only the second country worldwide to legalize the use of marijuana for recreational purposes in all provinces in October 2018. Unsurprisingly, most Canadians who approved of this legalization when surveyed in October 2018, were aged between 18 and 34. The highest rates of disapproval came from those aged 65 or over. Canadians aged 18 to 34 have also been the most active in the post-legalization cannabis market. For example, around 25 percent of this age group had visited a website that sells cannabis online and 17 percent had used cannabis in October 2018.
