 Around 5.4 million air conditioners (A/Cs) were shipped in the United States during 2019. Total shipment figures fluctuate year to year, but generally fall between 3.5 and 6 million, with a few notable exceptions such as the 6.47 million sold in 2005. Air conditioner market Having been invented over a century ago, air conditioner products comprise a mature and relatively stable market of the overall household appliance industry. In the United States, the total number of air conditioners exceeds the country’s population, and by 2030, forecasts suggest that China will play host to over a billion A/C appliances. Room air conditioners are by far the most popular type, while all-in-one packaged A/Cs account for a much smaller portion of overall demand. The top brands differ by country. The U.S. heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) market is dominated by American and Irish brands like Carrier, Trane, and York, while the South Korean air conditioner market is dominated by its own domestic giants in LG and Samsung. Overall, global demand for air conditioners is on the rise, and as the world becomes increasingly developed, this technology that was once seen as a luxury is now becoming more and more commonplace.
