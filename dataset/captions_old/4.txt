Determining value Market value and market capitalization are two terms frequently heard when discussing the profitability and viability of companies. Put simply, market capitalization, or market cap, is the worth of a company based on stock price; an important metric when determining value for potential trading opportunities. Market value, however, is what a company is worth in a much broader context and can change greatly depending on the business cycle. It is determined by multiple factors, including stockholder equity, corporate debt, and the market environment as a whole. The world’s top companies In fiscal year 2018, Apple’s global revenue stood at 265.6 billion U.S. dollars, but somewhat surprisingly, did not manage to crack the top ten of companies with the largest revenue. The American multinational retailer Walmart led the way as the largest company in the world when considering revenue and employment.
