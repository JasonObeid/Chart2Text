 This graph shows automotive electronics cost as a share of total car cost from 1970 to 2030. Electronics systems have vastly improved vehicle safety over the evolution of the car, such as airbags and anti-lock braking systems. In 2030, it is forecasted that on average, electronic systems will account for half of the total price of a new car.
