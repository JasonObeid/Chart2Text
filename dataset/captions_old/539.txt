 Inflation in Argentina was 34 percent in 2018, expected to rise to nearly 44 percent the following year before declining to 6 percent by 2024. A major factor in this is the legacy of poor fiscal discipline left by the economic depression from 1998 to 2002. What causes inflation? Inflation is a rise in price levels for all goods. Major causes of inflation include an increase in money supply, low central bank interest rates, and expectation of inflation. In a country such as Argentina, the expectation can be one of the biggest obstacles. People expect inflation to be high and demand increasing wages, and firms continue raising prices because they expect the costs of inputs to increase. Banks follow suit, charging high interest rates on fixed deposits. Effects of inflation Inflation negatively affects savers. 100 Argentinian pesos in 2018 will be worth just under 75 pesos in 2019, after adjusting for the 34 percent inflation rate. Similarly, frequently changing prices has its own inherent cost, called “menu cost” after the price of printing new menus. Inflation will also have a positive effect on national debt when that debt is denominated in Argentinian pesos, because the pesos will be cheaper when the loan matures. However, the majority of Argentina’s debts are in foreign currency, which means that inflation will make these debts larger in peso terms.
