 The price of solar photovoltaic modules in the United States has seen a fairly consistent decrease over the last few years. In Q3 2019, module prices averaged 0.31 U.S. dollars per watt, in comparison to 0.63 U.S. dollars per watt in Q1 2016. Solar system pricing has fallen in all markets, including residential, non-residential, and utility markets. The decline is largely due to declining hardware costs, primarily from lower module prices. The oversupply of modules due to decreasing demand from China lowered module prices; in turn, this has helped to alleviate the tariffs that were implemented on Chinese module exports to the United States. Solar price variations Prices of solar photovoltaics are consistently low in the United States, in comparison to many other countries. The price of solar can also vary within each U.S. state, mostly due to the cost of electricity. The components that are used in solar energy systems may also impact the price of solar photovoltaics. Falling global demand, high supply levels, and the resulting bidding competition have also pushed prices lower.
