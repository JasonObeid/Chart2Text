In fact, the average price per square meter for residential properties in Rome has decreased steadily since December 2016, when it registered a value of 3.25 thousand euros. However, a more detailed look into the city’s real estate market showed that residential dwellings in the most affluent areas of the city can fetch up to eight thousand euros per square meter. Positive signals for the real estate market In general, lower prices seem to have attracted interest in the real estate market in the city. The number of residential property transactions in Rome has increased steadily since reporting the lowest value in 2013, when about 23.8 thousand transactions where registered. Not a city for investments Despite boasting lower prices when compared to Milan, Rome didn’t seem to be able to catch the interest of foreign investors. In 2018, the Italian capital could attract only 19 percent of the total foreign investments in the real estate sector in Italy. Moreover, in a list of the most popular cities in Italy for residential property purchase for investment Rome ranked last behind all major Italian cities.
