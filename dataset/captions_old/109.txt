 As of the week ending January 9, 2020, Tones and I's 'Dance Monkey' was the most-streamed track on Spotify with 50.24 million streams worldwide, followed by ‘Yummy' by Justin Bieber with 36.77 million. How do music artists get so many streams on Spotify? Firstly, Spotify is one of the most successful and popular music streaming services in the United States, and as of the first half of 2018 had the biggest share of music streaming subscribers in the world. With Spotify’s vast audience, featuring on the platform is a good start for emerging and popular artists hoping to make an impact. Secondly, there is no exact science to ‘going viral’. From the famous egg photo on Instagram posted in early 2019 to wildly successful music video ‘Gangnam Style’ released back in 2012, viral content comes in all shapes and sizes. Purposeful viral marketing is one way in which something could go viral, and is one of the reasons why some songs have so many streams in a short space of time. This type of marketing involves a tactical approach and pre-planning in an attempt to push the content into the public eye and encourage it to spread as quickly as possible. However, many artists who go viral do not expect to. Accessible, catchy content created by an already popular artist is already poised to do well, i.e. the latest song or album from U.S. singer Drake. This is an example of incidental viral marketing, when content spreads by itself partially as a result of an established and engaged audience. Indeed, Spotify’s most-streamed tracks generally originate from a well-known figure with a large following. But for smaller or entirely unknown content creators, going viral or experiencing their 15 minutes of fame can simply be a case of posting the right thing at the right time.
