 The number of new car registrations in the European Union increased by 21.7 percent from December 2018 to December 2019. This is primarily due to a low baseline from December 2018 which saw low sales. In August 2018, European new-car intenders flocked to dealerships ahead of price increases tied to tougher emissions tests, and EU auto sales increased 31 percent over August 2017. It was the highest month-over-month growth rate between August 2018 and 2019. New car sales in Europe Around 15.3 million passenger cars have been sold to customers in the 28 EU markets in 2019. Europe is one of the largest regional markets for passenger cars. The largest country markets, represented by Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain, make up around 75 percent of car sales in the market. In 2018, Germany was the fourth largest single-country market in the world in terms of car sales, albeit closely followed by India. VW tops brand ranking With around 130,000 units sold in the EU in December 2019, Volkswagen was the best-selling car brand, while Renault was ranked as the second best-selling car brand in the EU. The other runner-ups included Mercedes-Benz, Ford, and BMW.
