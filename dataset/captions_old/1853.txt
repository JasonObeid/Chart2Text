 This statistic illustrates a the number of housing transactions in the United Kingdom (UK) forecasted from 2018 to 2022. According to the figures as of 2018, it can be seen that the number of housing transactions was forecasted to increase from approximately 1.18 million in 2018 to a total of 1.3 million by the year 2022. These figures would lead to an average of 1.21 million transactions per annum between the years 2018 and 2022. This increase in number of housing transactions can be somewhat related to the expected forecasted growth in housing completions in the United Kingdom (UK). It could be speculated that the larger number of housing completions could in turn lead to the higher availability and choice of property units offered for purchase, and as such could lead to lowering of house prices. This consequently could have an effect on the potential increase in the total number of housing transactions conducted on the British market.
