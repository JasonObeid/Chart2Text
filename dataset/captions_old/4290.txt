 This statistic shows total U.S. total arms imports in 2018 expressed in TIV, by country. The TIV is based on the known unit production costs of a core set of weapons and is intended to represent the transfer of military resources rather than the financial value of the transfer. The TIV is expressed here in million constant U.S. dollars as of 1990. In 2018, the U.S. arms imports from Australia totaled to about 30 million constant (1990) U.S. dollars. The depicted import value is only an indicator and does not correspond to the actual financial value of the transfers.
