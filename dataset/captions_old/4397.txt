 In 2016, the Ligue 1 TV broadcasting rights revenue amounted to 748 million euros. The broadcasting of football events is the live coverage of football matches on television or radio. In recent years, the global value of the French top football league is increasing, whether it concerns the market value of the teams or the transfer fee spending of Ligue 1 football clubs. An increase of TV broadcasting rights revenue It seems that the broadcasting rights revenue of the French Ligue 1 has been increasing since the beginning of the 2000s. In 2001, TV broadcasting rights for the French football league reached 275 million euros, compared to 748 million euros in 2016. For the 2017-2018 season, Paris Saint-Germain was the French football club which had the highest revenue collected from television rights, in front of Marseille and Olympique Lyonnais. The club's presence in the Champions League and its world-renowned players probably explain this position in the rankling. However, in comparison with the others big five European football leagues, the broadcasting rights of the Ligue 1 do not appear to be particularly high. In 2016, the broadcasting rights revenue of the Premier League, the top-level English football league, amounted to 3.2 billion euros, while the total revenue of the broadcasting rights of the Spanish Liga reached more than 1.4 billion euros. A new interest for the Ligue 1? Since the recent arrival of foreign investors in French football, the Ligue 1 is attracting more interest. With players like Neymar or Mbappé, Paris Saint-Germain has become a club followed throughout Europe despite its results in the Champions League. In 2017, the transfer fee spending of Ligue 1 football clubs reached a record number of 1.1 billion euros, compared to 283 million euros the year before. Even though the league’s revenue is still the lowest of the so-called “Big Five” European football leagues, Ligue 1 has a market value which is increasing since 2010.
