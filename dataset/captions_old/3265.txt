 In 2018, the total turnover of companies producing chocolate and confectionary was approximately four billion British pounds. Between 2011 and 2018 the turnover fluctuated. However, prior to 2011 turnover was much higher, reaching over five billion pounds in 2008. While turnover is down, the number of enterprises operating in the sector has risen. PRODCOM survey The data shown here comes from the UK Manufacturers' Sales by Product survey (called PRODCOM from “PRODuction COMmunautaire”). The survey is mandated by EU regulations. The aim is to provide a complete overview of the developments of industrial production in the EU area and make country comparisons possible. The data comes directly from the companies which are surveyed by the national statistical institutes of each country. UK producers’ sales of chocolate and confectionary The same drop that is visible in companies’ overall turnover is also visible in the sales value of chocolate, and confectionary manufactured in the UK. In 2011, the sales value dropped by 50 percent compared to 2010, amounting to 155 million British pounds. The sales value recovered slightly and amounted to 207 million pounds in 2017. Sugar confectionary saw a sales drop in 2012 but has not since recovered.
