 The revenue of Dell Technologies reached approximately 90 billion U.S. dollars in the 2019 fiscal year. Dell Technologies has three consecutive years of increasing net revenue, a welcomed change after nearly a half decade of decline, which was during a time of transition during which Dell was bought-out and privatized to recalibrate its business model. Dell’s transition in the IT industry Prior to 2013, Dell was a public company, with the bulk of its revenue made through PC sales. In 2013, after falling to a market share of just 10.4% of PC sales worldwide, founder and CEO Michael Dell bought out Dell for 24.4 billion U.S. dollars and made it private for a period of directional shift. In late 2018, Dell Technologies became a public company again. Reflecting the changing demands of digital transformation, the largest source of Dell Technologies’ revenue for fiscal year 2019 now comes from its Infrastructure Solutions business segment, which specializes in cloud and big-data solutions. Dell Technologies is the leading vendor worldwide both for cloud IT infrastructure and for storage systems.
