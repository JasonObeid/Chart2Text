 More than half of Americans wanted to start 2018 by saving money and by getting in shape. The most popular New Year’s resolution ever – “quit smoking” – was not as high up on the list as it used to be, but at least 16 percent decided to finally give up smoking once and for all. Resolution makers, resolution keepers? While some might say that they do not need New Year’s Eve to finally turn their life around, making resolutions on December 31 is a common, well-liked tradition, especially in the Western world. They are usually meant to contain some kind of improvement or betterment of one’s conduct or life choices. However, these resolutions are not compulsive; only a small share of people who make them actually keep them, according to a Statista survey. They are more like a signal for a new start than an actual catalyst for change. Traditional changes While they signal a change of choices and behavior, New Year’s resolutions themselves hardly ever change: When comparing the resolutions for 2018 and 2019, for example, it’s obvious that people still just want to be healthy and happy, maybe broaden their horizons, and save up – in general, be a sensible, content adult. This is not only true for Americans – Italians also wish for stable finances and their own and loved ones’ health, as do South Koreans.
