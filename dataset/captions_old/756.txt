 In 2017, the total population of the Philippines was at approximately 104.92 million inhabitants. For the foreseeable future, the Filipino population is expected to increase slightly, despite a current overall downward trend in population growth. The dwindling Filipino population For now, the population figures in the Philippines still show a steady increase and the country is still one of the most densely populated countries in the Asia-Pacific region, however, all signs point to a decline in the number of inhabitants in the long run: Just like the population growth rate, the country’s fertility rate, for example, has also been decreasing for years now, while the death rate has been increasing simultaneously. Poor healthcare to blame One of the reasons for the downward trend is the aging population; fewer babies are born each year, while life expectancy at birth has been steady over the years. Another reason is poor healthcare in the country: The Philippines have a high tuberculosis incidence rate, a highly infectious disease, and are among the countries with a high probability of death from noncommunicable diseases as well.
