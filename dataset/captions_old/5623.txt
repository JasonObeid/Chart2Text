 Whilst many Academy Award nominees are lucky enough to take home awards for their performances, some actors have received multiple nominations but thus far failed to secure a win. At the top of this ranking is Greg P. Russell, who has 16 nominations to his name, but is yet to win the coveted award. In 2019, Diane Warren made the list after having received her tenth nomination for her song "I'll Fight" from the documentary 'RBG', but failed to win an award that year.
