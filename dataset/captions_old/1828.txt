 Since 2010, the household price of electricity in Poland has seen little change, increasing from 13.41 euro cents per kilowatt-hour to 13.43 euro cents in the first semester of 2019. Looking at the figures, it can be seen that on average prices were cheaper in the second half of each year. A noticeable exception was in the second half of 2012, when prices increased by 1.11 euro cents compared the first half of the year. This was the peak price during the period of consideration. Price comparisons Compared to the rest of Europe, Polish households pay a reasonably low amount for electricity. In 2018, the price per kilowatt-hour reached 0.16 U.S. dollars. This was considerably less than neighboring Germany, where prices amounted to 0.33 U.S. dollars per kilowatt-hour. Electricity production The vast majority of electricity in Poland is produced by the burning of coal, with a share of almost 80 percent. Of this total, slightly under 50 percent was produced by hard coal. Due to its reliance on fossil fuels for energy, pollution is high in Poland. The country is home to 36 of the 50 most polluted European cities. One of the biggest polluters in Europe is the Bełchatów coal power plant, which emitted 38.2 megatons of CO2 equivalent in 2018.
