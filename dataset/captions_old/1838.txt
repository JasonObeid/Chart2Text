 This graph shows quarterly data regarding the number of daily active Zynga games users. In the third quarter of 2019, Zynga had 20 million of such gamers. In the second quarter of 2012, Zynga hit 72 million daily active users. That was an unprecedented result following only a relatively short period of growth. In the next quarter, the figure fell to 60 million and the negative trend persisted until the third quarter of 2015. If the number of Zynga’s monthly active users is considered, the development is very similar. In this case however, the record number was achieved in the third, not second quarter of 2012.
