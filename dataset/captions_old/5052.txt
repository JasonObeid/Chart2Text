 In 2017/18, the average number of dairy cows, otherwise known as the ‘national dairy herd’ size in the United Kingdom was approximately 1.9 million animals. The last three years have broken a downward trend that lasted from 2002/03 to 2013/14. However, the current herd size is still more than 300 thousand animals smaller than it was in 2002/03. UK milk production The modern dairy cow is especially bred for milk production. Even though the UK dairy herd in 2002/03 was bigger than the current herd, the current milk production surpasses the one in 2002/03 by a few hundred million liters of milk. This is reflected in an increased average milk yield per cow in the UK. UK Cheese productionCheese production in the UK is up. The last 4 years has consistently surpassed 400 thousand metric tons, amounting to 455 thousand tons in 2017/2018. By far the biggest attributor to UK production is cheddar cheese.
