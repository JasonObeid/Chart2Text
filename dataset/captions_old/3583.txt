 Nearly three out of five households in the United Kingdom (UK) own a tumble dryer, with figures from the UK’s Office for National Statistics showing that 58 percent of UK households own such a machine. The amount has not changed drastically over the past two decades, with 52 percent of households owning (synonym for own) a dryer in 1999/2000. Who are the two percent without a dryer? In contrast with washing machines, in which 100 percent of households from the sixth decile to the highest ten percent of income earners featured a washing machine, many households in the United Kingdom choose not to own a tumble dryer. The ninth decile of households by income show the highest rates of ownership, at 72 percent. Lower ownership elsewhere The 58 percent seen in the UK is not the lowest among similar markets. In Germany during 2017, for example, just 42.2 percent of private households owned a clothes dryer.
