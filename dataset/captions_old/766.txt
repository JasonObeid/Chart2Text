 With a brand value of around 75 billion U.S. dollars, Samsung was the most valuable South Korean brand in 2018, greatly surpassing Hyundai, LG as well as SK Hynix. With its headquarters in the northwestern South Korean city of Suwon, Samsung is a world leader in the manufacturing of consumer electronics and semiconductors. Globally, Samsung produces more smartphones and mobile phones than any other brand, and has a strong presence in the tablet, television and computer components markets. The evolution of Samsung In its early days, Samsung was recognized for producing cheap consumer electronic alternatives. Customer perceptions have changed over the years, largely due to Samsung’s successful branding and advertising strategy adopted in the 90s. Today, innovation and creativity are both values which Samsung seeks to encapsulate through its products. Accordingly, Samsung smartphone owners are loyal, with 77 percent of global Samsung consumers opting for their next purchase to be a Samsung mobile rather than an Apple iPhone. Samsung in numbers Samsung has come a long way from its early establishment in South Korea to its current position as a globally recognized multinational conglomerate. It achieved a global revenue of around 218 billion U.S. dollars in 2018. The largest department in terms of employment at Samsung’s headquarters was the ‘Device Solutions’ division in 2018. This department is responsible for ensuring the ‘inner workings’ of Samsung’s electronic devices are optimized in terms of performance and reliability. Most product development is not based in South Korea itself. As of the 3rd quarter of 2018, Samsung had registered over double the number of patents in the United States compared to in South Korea during that year. Consequently, global research and development spending at Samsung Electronics reached a 10-year high in 2018 - a trend that looks likely to continue in coming years.
