 As of January 2020, China was home to the largest number of pigs of any country with 335 million heads. That year, the European Union and United States were second and third in the list, with over 148 and 77 million heads respectively. Global overview There were about 677.6 million pigs worldwide as of January 2020, meaning that China was home to more than half of the global pig population. Unsurprisingly, China is the leading pork producer worldwide, producing about 55 million metric tons of pork each year. China’s global pork exports have been decreasing over the past few years, while the EU remained the top exporter with over three million metric tons of pork shipments last year. The United States is also among the main exporters and importers of pork worldwide. Mexico was the main importer of U.S. pork, followed by Japan, South Korea and Canada.
