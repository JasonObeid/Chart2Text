 weden’s gross domestic product declined between 2008 and 2009, and then increased annually until 2018. The dip in 2009 was caused by the financial crisis in 2008. The decline in growth rate was 5.2 percent, compared to the previous year, which was the largest fall in the GDP growth rate in Sweden since the Second World War. Household consumption affects the GDP There are many factors affecting the gross domestic product of a country, and the household consumption is one important factor. The household consumption is regulated by the level of employment in the country, and the economics of the households. During the period from 2011 to 2017, both the level of employment and the annual household disposable income increased, which in turn generated a higher household consumption. Export of goods Another important factor influencing Sweden’s GDP is the export of services and goods. The export of services increased quicker than the exports of goods for several years, but the export of goods are still larger than the export of services. The commodity with the largest exported value in 2017 was machinery and transport equipment, which was valued at around 528 billion Swedish kronor.
