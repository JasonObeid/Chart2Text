 In 2018/2019, Spain was the leading producer of fresh oranges in the European Union (EU28), with over 3.7 million tons of fresh oranges produced. The Spanish production was more than two times the production of Italy, the second largest producer of oranges. The other three producers in the EU produced less than one million tons during this year. Production outside the EU The United States produced about 11.5 to 13 million tons in the early 2000s. However, by 2017 the US production had fallen to just 300 thousand tons above Spanish production. 2017 was the year that for the first-time Mexican production surpassed that of the US. Turkish production almost reached 2 million tons in 2017 and the country surpassed Italian production by roughly 800 thousand tons, making it the second largest in the whole of Europe. Consumption of fruits and juice Orange juice consumption in countries such as Germany, the US, China and Canada is down and only the Mexican market shows a stable trend in consumption. Fruit consumption is down in many all parts of Latin America (Mexico, Argentina, Brazil) or stagnating (Guatemala, Costa Rica). With only a very few markets showing upwards trends, such as orange consumption in Austria, a further decrease in production or stagnation in production can be expected.
