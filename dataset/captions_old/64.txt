 The consumer price index rate in the United Kingdom is expected to be 1.82 percent in first quarter of 2020, before rising to 2 percent by the second quarter of 2022, which is where the rate is anticipated to remain at until at least the first quarter of 2024. Inflation target of two percent The forecasted inflation rate for the CPI, falls in line with the UK government’s targeted rate of 2 percent. As of October 2019, the inflation rate for the United Kingdom was 1.5 percent, falling from a high of 3.1 percent almost two years earlier in November 2017. The inflation rate target of the UK government was deemed to be “about right” by 52 percent of people in the UK. Hyperinflation In 2018 three countries were suffering from inflation rates of more than 50 percent, Sudan (63.29%), South Sudan (83.49%) and Venezuela (929,789.5%). The very high levels of inflation seen in Venezuela are a symptom of the country’s political and economic crisis, which saw the government attempt to print money in response to economic problems.
