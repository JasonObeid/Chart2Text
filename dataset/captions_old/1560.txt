 This statistic shows the total annual expenditure on furniture and furnishings in the United Kingdom from 2005 to 2018, based on volume. In 2018, UK households purchased approximately 19.1 billion British pounds worth of furniture and furnishings, an increase on the previous year of roughly one and a half billion British pounds. According to results of the 2017 Statista Global Consumer survey, 24 percent of UK consumers have bought furniture and household goods online in the last 12 months, while 33 percent claim to mostly look online for information about these products. Over the past seven years there has been a decline in the number of furniture manufacturing enterprises in the United Kingdom, with a decrease of nearly 150 manufacturing enterprises since 2008. It seems now that the United Kingdom is importing its furniture from outside of the European Union instead of manufacturing it dosmetically, with imports reaching 3.38 billion British pounds in 2016. This number has significantly increased since 2003, where only 1.79 billion British pounds worth of furniture goods were imported from non-European countries.
