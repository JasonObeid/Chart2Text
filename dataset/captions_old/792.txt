 Under Armour is an American sporting goods manufacturer, based in Baltimore, Maryland. In 2019, Under Armour employed about 16,400 people around the world. Under Armour is one of the largest sportswear and sporting goods manufacturers in the world, however it is still far behind Nike and adidas who are the dominating companies within this industry. How does Under Armour compare to other companies within the sportswear and sporting goods industry? The global sportswear industry is a lucrative sector, which is anticipated to continue to grow in the next years. Nike and adidas are two of the world's leading athletic apparel companies and their brand values are on another level in comparison to that of Under Armour. While Under Armour featured on a listing of the largest sportswear employers in 2018, it remains quite distant from the market leaders. Nike employs over 73,000 people worldwide, while adidas has more than 57,000 employees. This shows that both Nike and adidas are significant employers around the world and that Under Armour has still quite a way to go before it reaches such levels.
