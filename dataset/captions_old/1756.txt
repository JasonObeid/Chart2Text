 Pandora Radio was the most popular streaming service in the United States in June 2019, with a reach of 38 percent through its mobile app. Key competitor Spotify followed closely behind but failed to make the top spot, losing out to Pandora by a three percent margin. Other services on the ranking include iHeartRadio and Soundcloud. Pandora vs. SpotifySpotify’s subscriber base almost doubled between early 2017 and 2019, when the streaming service announced that it had reached 100 million subscribers worldwide. Spotify also commands the largest share of subscribers in the world, 34 percent more than Pandora's share and three times that of Amazon. Despite Spotify’s success, when taking a closer look at the U.S. market, Spotify tends to struggle, which is notable in a ranking of U.S. consumers’ preferred music streaming services. However, it was Pandora which was considered the most appealing overall, with respondents in all but the 18 to 29 age bracket citing Pandora as the service they would be most likely to subscribe to.
