 Between 2008 and 2018, each year roughly between 134,000 and 153,000 people died in the Netherlands. From 2014 onwards, the number of deaths increased annually, peaking in 2018 at roughly 153,000. That year, women were on average 81 years old when they died, men were five years younger. Neoplasms most common cause of death The most common causes of death in 2018 were neoplasms and diseases of the circulatory system, which made approximately 46,600 and 37,800 victims respectively. That year, five women died as a result of pregnancy complications and childbirth in the Netherlands. Fatal skin diseases were relatively rare as well, with less than 300 deaths. Birth excess The Netherlands has a birth excess: each year the number of live births exceeds the number of deaths in the country. Although some 150,000 people died in 2018, the birth of nearly 170,000 babies meant the Netherlands still had a birth excess of over 15,000. In the last decade, the birth excess dropped considerably though, from nearly 50,000 people in 2008 to under 20,000 in 2018.
