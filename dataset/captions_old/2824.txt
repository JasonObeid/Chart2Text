 This statistic displays the results of a survey on the share of individuals in Great Britain who purchased tickets for events online in 2019, by age and gender. The survey was conducted via interviews and gathered data from 1,800 households, a nationally representative sample of households in Great Britain. Households were sampled each month and estimates are subject to sampling variability. Purchasing event tickets online was most common among the 25 to 34 year old demographics, with 57 percent of individuals within this group having made event ticket purchases online in 2019. The total revenue from event tickets in the eServices market in the United Kingdom (UK) was forecast to reach a value of approximately 4.2 billion U.S. dollars by 2020, of which, when broken down by segment, 1.7 billion comes from cinema tickets, 1.2 billion from music events and 1.2 billion from sport events. When compared to other countries, the event ticket revenue in the eServices market in the UK is higher than that of France and Germany, yet only a fraction of the revenue in the United States.
