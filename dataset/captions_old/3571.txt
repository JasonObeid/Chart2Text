 The load factor of electricity from solar photovoltaics has seen an overall increase since 2010, amounting to 11.3 percent in 2018. However, this was a minor decrease from the previous year and significantly lower when compared to the load factors of other renewable sources. This can be explained by the lack of consistency in the number of sunny days recorded. In comparison, the load factor for offshore wind reached 39 percent. Capacity and generation In the same year, solar PV accounted for 29.6 percent of the total renewable capacity. However, its share of renewable electricity generation was just 11.7 percent. This was due to the relatively low load factor. In 2010, electricity generated by solar PV amounted to 41 gigawatt-hours. By 2017 this had increased to more than 11,500 gigawatt-hours. Turnover and employment drop In 2017 the UK’s solar PV industry reported a turnover of 1.3 billion euros. This was a decrease of more than one billion euros compared to the previous year. As turnover decreased, so did employment figures. In 2016 there were approximately 29,000 employees in the sector, but the following year this number dropped by more than half due to cuts to subsidies.
