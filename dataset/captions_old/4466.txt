Deaths in France Despite being the second most populous country in Europe, France was ranked fourth in term of number of deaths in Europe in 2017. As in other Western countries, the leading causes of death among the French population appear to be diseases and cancer. In 2015, more than 71 thousand French women died of cancer, compared to 95 thousand men. Circulatory system diseases were also one of the most frequent causes of death. Regarding external causes of death, France has been fighting for years against road deaths. Prevention campaigns, as well as new traffic regulations, have led to a decrease in road deaths in France since 2006. Aging in France France has one of the highest life expectancies in Europe. In 2018, female life expectancy at birth reached 85.4 years, while male life expectancy amounted 79.5 years. The French appear to be concerned about health issues, now that the population of the country is getting older. However, since the mid-2000s the number of healthy life years of French citizens at birth come over 63 years old, whereas it reaches 58 years old in Germany.
