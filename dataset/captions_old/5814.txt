 In 2018, the purchasing power in the Netherlands increased for the fourth year in a row. Purchasing power growth slowed down considerably though in 2017 and 2018 in comparison to 2015 and especially 2016. In the next two years, the purchasing power was forecast to increase further. A second forecast predicts that a large number of Dutch households will experience an increase in purchasing power. Just over 22,000 households were forecast to see a growth of five percent or more. Singles with average income see purchasing power grow the most The singles with average incomes (35,000 euros) were expected to see the most significant increase in their purchasing power in 2019, at over two percent. With the exception of couples with one child on a double income (earning between 10,000 and 25,000 euros) though, all other household types could foresee a growth in purchasing power. Purchasing power under Rutte III-government Pensioners and people on social security benefits are especially vulnerable to the dynamics of a changing economic situation. Another forecast released just before the Rutte III government was inaugurated in October 2017 predicts a growth of the purchasing power for all groups under the new government: the working, the pensioners and the recipients of benefits. It was however expected that the purchasing power of the employed group would increase far more than the purchasing power of pensioners and people on social security: 1.4 percent vs. 0.6 and 0.7 percent.
