 Light truck retail sales in the United States increased to 12.2 million units in 2019, the highest level on record. This number has been increasing since 2010, when the auto industry began recovering from low vehicle purchases during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. In 2018, sales of light trucks accounted for about 72 percent of the approximately 17 million light vehicles sold in the United States. Ford, with its signature truck, the Ford F-150, is the leading North American car brand in the United States. Why are consumers buying trucks now? The U.S. economy has largely recovered from the woes of the financial crisis and unemployment rates fell to 3.7 percent in 2019. This, coupled with a low unemployment rate, means that consumers are better able to purchase new vehicles. Similarly, due to lower gasoline and diesel fuel prices, motorists are more willing to buy trucks over smaller, more fuel-efficient sedans.
