 During the 2019-2020 season of the French top professional football league, Ligue 1, Paris-Saint-Germain (PSG) was the football club with the highest average annual player salary. A football player of PSG earned close to nine million euros on average per year. For comparison, this is more than eight times what a player at OGC Nice makes. The football club based in Paris, which should be crowned champion for this season, shows once again its supremacy upon its Ligue 1 competitors. The wage gap of French football The numbers provided in this ranking indicate that Olympique Lyonnais (OL) and Olympique de Marseille (OM), two of the biggest clubs in France, do not offer to their players half of PSG’s average annual salary. The gap between PSG and the other French clubs is even more obvious when looking at the average salary of players of Nîmes or Amiens who do not earn more than 500,000 U.S dollars per year. PSG, one of the richest club in Europe For the 2019/20 Ligue 1 season, the five highest-paid football players in the championship were all PSG players. Brazilian forward Neymar had the highest gross salary of the French Ligue 1. Since the State of Qatar took over the club in 2011, PSG became the richest club in France and one of the wealthiest in Europe. The average annual first-team PSG player salary had increased since 2014 and Kylian Mbappé and Neymar, both transferred to PSG in 2017, became two of the players with the highest estimated transfer value worldwide.
