 Global consumption of rice has seen a slight increase over the last several years. In the 2018/2019 crop year, about 490.27 million metric tons of rice was consumed worldwide, up from 437.18 million metric tons in the 2008/2009 crop year. Rice cultivation Rice requires specific growing conditions to be successfully cultivated. It must be grown in a flooded field in several inches of water. Once the unprocessed rice is harvested, it is known as paddy rice. In 2017, China produced 210.3 million metric tons of paddy rice, making that country the top producer of paddy rice worldwide. India had the largest harvest area of rice in the 2017/2018 crop year, at 43.79 million hectares, while China harvested 30.18 million hectares of rice in that year. Rice trade worldwide In addition to having the largest harvest area of rice, India also was the top exporter of rice in the 2018/2019 fiscal year. During that time period, India exported 12.5 million metric tons of rice. Despite being the top producer of rice worldwide, China’s consumption of rice cannot be satisfied by domestic production. China is also the top importer of rice of any country in the world, at over 4.5 million metric tons of rice.
