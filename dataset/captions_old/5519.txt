 As of December 2019, some 18.4 percent of surveyed males had consumed marijuana or cannabis in the past three months in Canada. In comparison, 15.1 percent of female respondents had used the recently legalized drug in the same time period. The legalization of cannabis in Canada Following a similar trend in the United States, the legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada has become a hot topic in politics and in the public realm. Canada has provided legal access nationwide to medical marijuana since 2001, and the country established the legalization of cannabis for recreational purposes in all provinces in October 2018. Cannabis edibles One year on, the Canadian government will legalize the sale and use of marijuana edibles, cannabis extracts and topical products in October 2019. Just over 50 percent of Canadians approved of further legalization when surveyed in October 2018. The market is expected to boom, with the edible cannabis segment estimated to be worth around 1.6 billion Canadian dollars by the end of 2019. To have fun with friends and to reduce stress or anxiety were two of the top reasons for using cannabis-infused edibles among current and likely users.
