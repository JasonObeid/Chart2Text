 The statistic depicts Mexico's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate from 2014 to 2018, with projections up until 2024. GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year. It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country. Real GDP is adjusted for price changes and is therefore regarded as a key indicator for economic growth. In 2018, Mexico's real GDP grew by about 2 percent compared to the previous year. Mexico's economy Mexico, having not been dramatically affected by the 2002 South American crisis, has one of the strongest economies in the Americas behind the United States and Canada. By improving its macroeconomic rules and regulations, Mexico improved on many aspects of its economy, most notably inflation. Several goals that the government wanted accomplish were the improvement of infrastructure around the country as well as newer tax laws that would allow for higher income equality. Mexico is generally an export-oriented country, with the majority of export goods consisting of electronics, automobiles and agricultural goods. Exports over the past decade have seen continuous growth, with the exception of 2009. This increase in exports is largely due to an increasing number of free trade agreements with international countries, which essentially eliminate tariffs between member countries. However, Mexico imports more than they export, having recorded an annual trade deficit over the past decade. While most economics label this as a negative aspect, other economics believe that trade deficits are associated with positive economic developments.
