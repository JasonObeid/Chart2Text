 In 2019, Ford’s U.S. market share was around 14.1 percent, trailing only General Motors (GM). The two largest U.S. brands are relentless competitors in the global automobile industry. GM and Ford The competition between Ford and General Motors has played out strongly in the case of truck sales, with GM taking the lead in the first quarter of 2019 with a market share of 44 percent. This is partly because one of Ford’s auto parts suppliers, Meridian Magnesium, experienced a devastating factory fire in May 2018. This stopped production of the Ford F-150, one of the company’s most popular vehicles and the best-selling light truck in the United States. GM, in contrast, has had success with incentives on its pickup Chevrolet Silverado. A transition away from passenger cars In 2018, Ford announced that - by 2020 - almost 90 percent of its North American model selection will consist of trucks and commercial vehicles. This clear shift away from the car business was probably spurred by the fact that Ford's sales of crossovers and sports utility vehicles (SUVs) increased by over six percent in 2018.
