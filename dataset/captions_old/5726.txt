Over a third of all alcohol consumed is beer. It is closely followed by wine consumption with slightly less than a third of alcoholic drinks consumed. In 2017, beer consumption saw a notable uptick for the first time since 2003. In the past seven years consumption had stagnated after it fell from a high of 93.9 liters per head in 2003. Where beer is bought The place where people consume beer is changing. Today people are less likely to buy beer in bars, restaurants, and pubs and instead more frequently purchase other alcoholic drinks like wine. Consequently, the share of off-trade sales has been growing. In 2017, 53.1 percent of all beer sales happened off-trade. This constitutes an increase of over 20 percent in since the start of the millennium. Beer is most commonly consumed at home, with sinking off-trade sales it is likely that more beer will be consumed at home.
