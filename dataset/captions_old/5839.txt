 As of June 2018, at the beginning of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Kylian Mbappé was the the most valuable French football player. His market value reached 120 million euros and became even higher for the 2018-2019 season after a successful World Cup for France. Playing as a forward for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the French Ligue 1, Kylian Mbappé was also the club’s most valuable player. Born in 1998, Mbappé is not only considered one of the best players in the world, his career also shows the importance of money in football in recent years. France: most valuable team of 2018 According to figures from Transfermarkt, France was the national football team with the highest market/transfer value in 2018. Its market value reached 1.08 billion euros, whereas the Germany squad, winner of the 2014 World Cup, had a value of 884 million euros. Performances, but also age, current club and other clubs’ interest determine the value of a football player in the transfer market. Thus, Antoine Griezmann, second most valuable French player, had a market value of 100 million euros in 2018. His market value was higher than the ones of Toni Kroos, most valuable German player, and Sergio Busquets, most valuable Spanish player. However, the French team has not always been the most expensive team in the world. In 2016, Paul Pogba was the most valuable player of the national team. His market value amounted to 70 million euros for 90 million euros in 2018. In comparison France was listed fourth in the ranking of the 2014 FIFA World Cup most valuable football squads. The explosion of football players values Since 2010, the total transfer fee spending of the Big-Five league football clubs increased. European football clubs spent more than 5.1 billion euros during the summer transfer window in 2017, compared to 1.8 billion in 2011. The value of football teams has exploded since then with the English Premier League being the most expensive league on the transfer market. Football clubs are richer and ready to spend more money on famous players. In 2018, Juventus Turin spent 117 million euros on Cristiano Ronaldo.
