 In the fourth quarter of 2019, Venmo’s net payment volume amounted to 29 billion U.S. dollars, representing a 56 percent year-on-year growth. The company had more than 40 million active accounts at the end of the first quarter of 2019. Venmo usage in the United States Venmo is a U.S.-based digital wallet service owned by PayPal. According to a March 2019 survey of online payment users in the United States, 20 percent of respondents had used Venmo in the past 12 months. Parent company PayPal ranked first with a U.S. audience reach of 89 percent. However, during the same survey, only six percent of respondents stated that they used Venmo to pay for their online purchases, indicating that the service was more popular for peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfers than for online shopping payments. Venmo ranks as one of the most popular P2P payment services in the United States, along with Zelle and Square Cash. Venmo was originally created so friends could quickly split bills and the app has a stronger social networking component than other payment apps. When making a transaction, the transaction details (minus the payment amount) are shared on the user's news feed and to the user's network of friends and contacts, similar to a social media feed. Every transaction has a memo line where users involved in the transaction can comment on the nature of the payment – rent, pizza, or movie tickets, and the app suggests emoji instead of words. In 2018, the FTC has demanded that Venmo make it more obvious to consumers that their transactions were largely public and that it should be easier for users to change their privacy settings. The company maintains that the social experience of the public feed is one of the core appeals of the app, but also stated that users were able to change their settings to private.
