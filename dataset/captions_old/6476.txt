 The number of bank branches for the Banco Santander Group decreased with some fluctuation globally between 2012 and 2019. The Spanish bank employs approximately 196 thousand staff and has a customer base that grew by one million between 2018 and 2019. As of the end of 2019, the number of Banco Santander branches in Spain fell by more than one thousand. Despite Spain still having the largest number of Santander branches in Europe, the UK boasted having more customers, second only to Brazil on a global scale. Santander focuses its operations Compared to other leading European banks, the Banco Santander Group operates in far less countries globally. In 2018, the French bank BNP Paribas operated in more than four times as many countries worldwide than Banco Santander. In fact, the Spanish bank operates in less countries than any of the other top ten leading European banks. Bank branches continue to fall in Europe With the rise in online banking, and the need from customers for physical stores lessening, it may come as no surprise that the number of bank branches in Europe in operation has fallen annually between 2007 and 2018.
