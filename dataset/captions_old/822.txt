 First released in 2009, League of Legends (LoL) is an online multiplayer battle arena game in which players assume the role of a summoner that controls a champion with special abilities. These champions then battle against another team and try to gain victory by destroying the opposing team’s base. As with many online games, players can gain experience points through playing the game and completing certain missions. This ranking system is then used to match players of similar skill levels against each other in online games. The League of Legends ranking system has nine levels to indicate the skill level of the gamer. Amongst North American players, the silver skill level was the most common tier, achieved by 32.77 percent of players. Meanwhile, only a small handful of gamers were able to reach the top levels within the game. For casual and professional gamers alike League of Legends has built a loyal and large fanbase in the ten years since its release. The game reached a landmark 100 million monthly active users in 2016, an impressive increase from the 15 million users it had in 2011. As a result of its entertaining and varied gameplay, League of Legends has also become one of the most popular games amongst eSports viewers. The League of Legends eSports championship finals in 2018 became one of the most watched eSports events in history as almost 100 million unique viewers tuned in. With so many people watching this event, it comes as no surprise that the prize pool is sizeable.
