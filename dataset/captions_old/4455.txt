 The financial crisis that burst out in 2008, alongside with the consequential problems on the labor market and high unemployment rates, affected in particular the south of Italy. Despite an overall improvement of the country’s economic situation over the last years, some significant differences between the regions still can be observed. When it comes to the unemployment rates, in 2018 Calabria, Sicily and Campania were the three regions where the share of inhabitants without a job exceeded 20 percent. The situation appears even more difficult for workers aged between 15 and 24 years. In the year considered, more than a half of the young citizens from the above-mentioned regions did not have job. More than 30 percent of young Italians without a job Since 2010 the share of young citizens without a job in Italy has increased, reaching its peak in 2014. Despite a steadily improvement which started a year later, in 2018 still three out of ten young people did not have paid employment. Youth unemployment in the European Union In January 2019, Italy was the EU Member State the second highest youth unemployment rate. The ranking was led by Greece, where about 40 percent of citizens younger than 25 years did not have job.
