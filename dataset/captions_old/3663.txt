 345,496 students were registered in universities and other higher education institutions in Sweden during the fall semester 2017. Among these, the highest number of students as registered at Stockholm University, amounting to almost 46 thousand students. Stockholm University is ranked among the world’s top 100 universities, and is located in the capital, which is also Sweden’s largest city. High share of the population with upper secondary education degrees Sweden has a high number of citizens with upper secondary education degrees, and since the year 2000 the individuals with upper secondary education increased, while the individuals without decreased. In 2017, 24.9 percent of the male population in Sweden had an upper education degree of three years and 21.7 percent of the female population. Long tradition of state financial aid One reason for the high share of the population with a university or higher education institution degree might be the long tradition of state financial aid for students. Swedish residents who are studying can apply for student grants, and loans with a low interest rate. A little over 171 thousand students in Sweden received both subsidies and loans in 2017.
