 This statistic represents the annual pre-tax profit of the British automotive company Jaguar Land Rover from financial year 2011 to financial year 2019 in million British pounds. Between 2011 and 2018, the company made a pre-tax profit higher than one billion British pounds in every year. However, the most recent financial year suggested a more difficult business climate, as the company recorded its first pre-tax loss in this period of consideration, at 3.6 billion British pounds.
