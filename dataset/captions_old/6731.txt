 This statistic shows the median age of the population in Luxembourg from 1950 to 2050. The median age is the age that divides a population into two numerically equal groups; that is, half the people are younger than this age and half are older. It is a single index that summarizes the age distribution of a population. In 2015, the median age of the Luxembourger population was 39.3 years.
