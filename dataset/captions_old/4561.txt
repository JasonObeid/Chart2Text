 The statistic presents the value of homeowner equity in the United States from 1960 to 2018. Home equity value is calculated by subtracting the value of remaining mortgage debt from the market value of the real estate property. That means that the value of home equity increases as the debtor pays off the mortgage. The value of homeowner equity in the United States increased from approximately 6.16 trillion U.S. dollars in 2010 to approximately 15.54 trillion U.S. dollars in 2018.
