FC Barcelona - additional information FC Barcelona’s brand and team value increased significantly in 2014, thanks in part to the high-profile signing of Luis Suarez from Liverpool FC in July 2014. His acquisition for between 81 and 94 million euros broke Barcelona’s transfer record from 2009, when they bought Zlatan Ibrahimovic from Inter Milan for an estimated 69 million euros. However, Barcelona will be unable to utilize the 2015 winter and summer transfer windows as FIFA banned the club from buying players following the violation of its rules about the transfer of footballers aged under 18. FC Barcelona has been able to embark on a successful strategy of cutting costs and securing premium partners such as Audi and Estrella Damm, in addition to kit and shirt sponsorship from Nike and Qatar Airways. These elements resulted in FC Barcelona producing total revenue of over 484 million euros in the 2013-2014 season. For the 2014/15 season Barcelona also announced a global commercial partnership with Beko, which saw the company’s corporate logo placed on the sleeve of the team’s kits. The Camp Nou, Europe's largest football stadium, has a capacity of 98,787, with average attendance figures consistently over 70,000 in recent seasons. In the 2014/15 season, Barcelona’s average attendance was over 73,000, beaten only by Real Madrid’s average attendance of over 76,000.

As of 2014, FC Bayern Munich was the most valuable football brand in the world, with an estimated worth of 896 million dollars.
