 Many of the largest solar power facilities in the world are located in India and China. For example, the Tengger solar park in China is located in Zhongwei, Ningxia, covering 1,200 kilometers of the Tengger desert and has an output of 1,547 megawatts of power. In India, Bhadla solar farm, located in the Rajasthan Jodhpur district is set to be in operation in December 2019. It is expected to be able to produce 2,255 megawatts of electricity and is spread across 45 square kilometers. In this case, the term solar plant refers to individual projects developed by a single developer or consortium, whether or not it is spread over different sites or is under various phases of development. Solar parks are multiple plants in one area under one entity. Nowadays, the largest solar parks have more than 50 individual solar power plants. This concept was first developed in India and China when suitable locations were found that could host several plants. Solar market in AsiaChina and India are both among the top five countries in the world in terms of cumulative solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity. In general, Asia dominated the global solar market with 70 gigawatts of solar PV capacity added in 2018 – more than the rest of the world combined. Most notably, the potential for solar energy is very high in many Southeast Asian countries, but the market remains largely untapped. This is mostly due to a lack of energy policy encouraging solar and no optimal financing models or infrastructure.
