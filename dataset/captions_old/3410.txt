 The average house rent price in the Netherlands reached a value of approximately 16 euros per square meter in the third quarter of 2019. This was an increase of 3.6 percent compared to the previous year, an increase the source describes as “rather moderate”. This because housing prices tended to increase at much higher rates in 2019. Note that the numbers shown in this statistic are not from a governmental institution, but concern rental housing being offered on the website of the source in the specific quarters. This implies the numbers only show rents of property on the free market and excludes social housing. No difference was made between the type of rental housing, such as houses, apartments, rooms or studios. Big cities well above the average rent price Cities in the Randstad area (the areas surrounding Amsterdam, The Hague, Utrecht and Rotterdam) have a big influence on the average rental price in the Netherlands. This is especially true for Amsterdam, as the Dutch capital registered an average rent price of roughly 23 euros per square meter at the end of 2019. Utrecht (18 euros per square meter), The Hague and Rotterdam (both around 16 euros) were also well above the national average, but rents in these cities increased at a higher rate than in Amsterdam. Are these rents expensive or not? A historical development of rent price indices suggests that rents in the Netherlands are at their highest level since 1990. This graph, however, does not mention whether it has a correction for inflation or not. It is unclear whether any institution researched the development of “real” rent prices for the Netherlands. Statista can offer two components for a potential comparison: the annual housing rent percentage increase between 1990 and 2019 as well as the inflation rate of the Netherland from 2008 to 2018.
