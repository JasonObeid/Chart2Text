 This statistic represents the energy costs of lighting a six-foot Christmas tree, lit 12 hours a day for 40 days, decorated with various light types. Americans choosing not to burn down their house during Christmas season should stay away from real candles anyway, and if they also prefer spending their money on Christmas presents instead of the Christmas tree decoration, LED lights are the best choice - decorating the tree with 280 LED lights for 40 days costs only 0.61 U.S. dollars.
