 Tom Brady is widely heralded as one of the best American football players of all time. The New England Patriots quarterback has won a total of 30 playoff games during his career, almost double that of his closest rival on the list, Joe Montana. Tom Brady – a football great A legend of the game, Tom Brady has played in nine Super Bowls and has emerged victorious in six of them. He was present in all six of the New England Patriots’ Super Bowl wins between 2002 and 2019, putting him at the franchise top of the list of most Super Bowl wins of all time. The Pittsburgh Steelers also have six Vince Lombardi trophies to their name, the last coming back in 2009. Tom Brady is peerless when it comes to total passing yards for the New England Patriots – his over-74,000 yards are more than double those of Drew Bledsoe, who occupies second place on the Patriots’ all-time list. However, the bragging rights for the most passing yards in NFL history do not belong to Brady, but to fellow legendary quarterback, Drew Brees. The Texas native has thrown over 77 thousand passing yards in a career that started back in 2001. NFL playoffs The NFL playoffs is a knockout tournament held amongst the best six teams from the regular season. The culmination of this tournament is the Super Bowl, which is one of the biggest events on the sporting calendar.

The Cowboys have gone all the way to the Super Bowl title on five occasions, most recently in 1996.
