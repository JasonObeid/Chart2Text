 This 2015 statistic shows how worried British respondents are about a terrorist attack happening in Britain. The largest share of respondents reported feeling quite worried, with over 40 percent, while 4 percent reported feeling not worried at all.

Yet despite this fact the perceived threat of a terrorist attack remains high.
