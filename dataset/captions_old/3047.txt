 This statistic shows the monthly number of new Vauxhall cars registered in the United Kingdom (UK) between July 2016 and December 2019. In December 2019, there were roughly 6,200 new Vauxhall cars registered in the UK. This value is around half the number sold in December 2018. Despite the fall in sales volume and a loss of market share in 2019, Vauxhall is one of the leading car companies in the UK. The peaks seen in March and September are due to the issuing of new registration plates by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency.
