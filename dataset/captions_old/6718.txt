 In 2019, apparel sales accounted for the largest share of Under Armour’s worldwide revenue, with a 66 percent share. 21 percent of the company’s net revenue was made through footwear sales that year. Footwear sales setting the pace The strong growth of Under Armour’s footwear segment – rising seven percent since 2012 – has contributed towards the shrinking sales share of its apparel category. Between 2015 and 2016, Under Armour’s footwear sales increased by 333 million U.S. dollars worldwide, pushing annual revenue from the sector above one billion U.S. dollars for the first time. The brand’s footwear line covers a wide range of sports and activities, but sales are led by running shoes. It is worth pointing out that sales of apparel continue to grow, but at a slower rate than footwear. Understanding the customers’ needs and wants Increasing sales from both its footwear and apparel units resulted in Under Armour’s global net sales exceeding five billion U.S. dollars for the first time in 2018. The company succeeded by responding to shifts in consumer preferences: a growing interest in performance products and a recognition of the benefits of an active lifestyle. When Under Armour first launched in 1996, it focused on compression shirts for men, but the company has since expanded its reach to women. An equal share of male and female consumers in the United States consider Under Armour to be their favorite sportswear brand.
