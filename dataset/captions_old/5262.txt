Shifting consumption patterns Despite more than 370 million magazine sales occurring during 2018 in the UK, the volume of print sales has more than halved since 2011. The value of print magazine sales in the UK has also suffered in recent years, falling by almost 60 million British pounds between 2017 and 2018. Although sales have continued to fall for print magazines, it appears that there is still an appetite for the content. As of 2017, over two thirds of individuals in the UK now consume either news, newspapers or news magazines online.
