Women in the workforce Women in the workforce have historically not been treated the same way as men . There are many inequalities in all aspects of work , from salaries to promotion , although worldwide , the number of women joining the workforce has been increasing . Women were originally relegated to being stay-at-home wives and mothers who were supposed to take care of the household while men worked . For a long time , women were not able to attend university , which barred them from gaining an education and a professional job . However , as society developed , women have been granted equal access to university . Despite this , the unemployment rate of women in the United States has fluctuated significantly since 1990 . In 2017 , Minnesota was the state with the highest percentage of women participating in the civilian labor force .

This statistic shows the degree of urbanization in Thailand from 2008 to 2018 . Urbanization means the share of urban population in the total population of a country . In 2018 , 49.95 percent of Thailand 's total population lived in urban areas and cities . The migration of the Thai population to metropolises and urban areas Thailand is in the midst of transforming itself from a predominantly rural country to an increasingly urban one . In as little as ten years , the country has shifted from 36 percent urban to almost 50 percent urban , which means that half of the population now lives in cities and urban areas . While Thailand 's urbanization rates are still low compared to other developed nations - which can reach levels of 80 - 90 percent - , this transformation in Thailand is still significant , especially as most of this growth occurs and is expected to occur in the Krung Thep area , better known as Bangkok , capital and largest city in Thailand . Krung Thep is now home to more than 5.7 million people . The number of tourists and overnight visitors to the city is also on the rise : In 2015 alone , the city had more than 18 million visitors . This development will place increasing demands on urban infrastructure , as the city grows and grows . The second largest city in Thailand is Nonthaburi , but it only has around one quarter of a million inhabitants , a significant difference . Despite the country 's rural but shifting population , Thailand 's fertility rate is low and below the natural replacement rate , and population growth in general is thus only minimal . Interestingly , despite this migration , agriculture has retained a stable share in GDP generation , actually increasing slightly over time , while the contributions of industry and services to GDP have also remained relatively the same .

Population in Bangladesh Bangladesh has one of the highest population densities in the world . While the economy is growing at a fair rate , gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita is still low . This points to Bangladesh 's status as a developing nation . However , these indicators also suggest that the country continues to flourish . This development can benefit a significant number of people . Other development indicators As health outcomes improve , life expectancy should follow . This will lead to an upward shift in the population pyramid , which measures the age structure in a country .
